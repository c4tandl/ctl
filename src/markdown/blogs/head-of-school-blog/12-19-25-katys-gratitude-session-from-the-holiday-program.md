What wonderful singing and recorder-playing we had on Wednesday, and what a joyful experience it was to be together! 



Here is an edited version of my remarks from the evening, just to share the gratitude a bit more. Know that I mean every word and I feel so lucky to lead this community of families. 



From Wednesday:



I feel so much gratitude — for the kids, for the school’s families, for our teachers — for the common project that each person in this room participates in together — CTL! And I’m happy to say happy birthday to this beautiful school. It’s CTL’s thirty-fifth birthday this year, and we’re so excited about all the ways this birthday has inspired us to look back at our roots while we also steam on toward the future. 



Unbelievably, this is the one night per year when we have all the school’s families here in the room, and also have many of our grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, younger and older siblings, and even alumni. And it’s a great time to put our hands together and show our appreciation for CTL families. Thank you for the lunches, the homework help, the driving, the hugs, for finding the lost mittens, for giving reminders about the bookbag every morning, for everything you do to partner with CTL and to support these amazing kids. Thank you, CTL families! 



I’d like to give a special thanks to CTL’s Board of Directors. Our Board guides the school’s strategic future, largely through their unwavering support for me, for which I am unendingly grateful. They bring a wide set of skills to their volunteer work to keep our school moving forward. I’ll ask you each to stand as I call your name and we can show our thanks for you all together. Josh Manahan, Pia Neilson, Peter Branch, Aura Doak, Jessica Tindal, Brita Wanger, Katy Papagiannis, and Maureen Barbieri. Thank you.



And I would like to take time to thank those who make tonight’s amazing concert possible.

Every Wednesday at CTL we have music infuse our day when Kaity comes to share her gifts with the Pre-K through grade 4 classes. She makes a major positive contribution to the school and she has made this concert really special. Thank you, Kaity.

On some Wednesdays and Fridays this year we have been so grateful to have Nora and Arlo’s mom,  Leah, joining us and sharing her musical talent! Thank you, Leah.

Thank you to Brita for bringing her showtime experience to the concert and supporting us all from the pit.

A special thank you to Alice and Billy’s dad, Doug, who enlivens Morning Meeting every day with his love of music and who made tonight’s concert possible. Thank you, Doug. 



And I would like to take time to thank the other people who make it all possible here at CTL, the people we love and depend on every day, our amazing teachers and staff! 



Always patient, always ready to help a child sort out a problem or celebrate something special to them, someone who knows kids so well, thank you, Haley.



First teacher to bring our students to their love of reading, best baker, big-hearted lover of kids, always ready to give a warm hug, thank you, Jennifer.



Our teacher of musical transitions, morning greetings, amazing illustrations, and thoughtful care for each student, thank you, Corbin.



Organized, clear, and consistent, this teacher leads a classroom where every child has a place and knows how to thrive; thank you, Jill.



Wearer of many hats, our most amazing art teacher, a person who can bring every student onto the stage to shine, deeply committed writer, reader, and teacher of our 10, 11, and 12 year olds, thank you, Angela.



Intelligent and efficient, caring and clear, our middle school is led by a teacher who is truly talented at helping students write from the heart, thank you, Stacey.



We’ve been so excited to welcome this even-tempered, patient, and kind teacher of math and science, thank you, Ian.



Our aftercare wizard, who sees kids’ spirits and meets every child where they are; thank you, Cate.



Gentle, deeply caring, providing quiet support and love for every person; thank you, Kennedy.



Artistic, positive, ray-of-sunshine every single day, our ceramics maven; thank you, Erika.



Full of energy, motivated, excited about life, willing to take on any task and ever-reliable; thank you, Kariska.

Energetic, lively skier, kickball ref and all-around good sport, thank you, Molly.

The woman who keeps our school looking beautiful, and does it with a smile and a positive attitude every single day (plus she’s super funny), thank you, Patty.



Our trusty handyman who can fix any issue, thank you, Ben.



The most reliable person in the school, whether you need a bandaid, a cough drop, an aftercare sign up, or a photocopy, thank you, Sarah.



Our backstage manager who keeps our finances on track and works with the school’s supporters near and far; thank you, Louise.



And I would like to take the time to make sure that my friend Anne has a proper introduction to the wider school community and a big CTL welcome. Come on up, Anne. Anne attended CTL for nine years, taught here for nine years, and has now returned as our Assistant Head of School. She’s already made herself felt with the students as a sunny and helpful presence, and her intelligence, efficiency, and organization are something we never forgot and are glad to have back. We are so excited to have you return to CTL, Anne, and thank you for being here. 



And let’s give our biggest thank you to our most important people, the students. Thank you for being you. 



I hope that everyone has a wonderful holiday season this year and I look forward to seeing all of you in the new year. 



Happy holidays and thank you for being part of CTL. 



Love, Katy
