Dear CTL Families, 

We are so excited to share CTL’s new Spiritwear School Store, the Acorn Shop! 

We hope that you find the perfect pieces for yourselves, your kids, friends, and family members. There are a huge assortment of items from t-shirts and sweatshirts to shorts, pants, hats, scarves, bags, and tumblers. 

When you order, items will be shipped directly to your home. The store is ‘open’ 24/7 and there is no order minimum. 

This type of spiritwear is new to CTL, so please let us know if you see something that needs to be corrected. We may also be able to take requests, so reach out if you have an idea of something you would like to see in the store.

Thank you very much to Jessica for putting it all together and to Katy P. for the design work. 

We can’t wait to see the whole community looking stylish in CTL gear! 

Take care and keep in touch, 

Katy
