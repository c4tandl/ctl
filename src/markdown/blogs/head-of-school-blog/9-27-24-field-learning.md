9/27/24 - Field Learning

Hello, CTL Families,\
Field learning a strong facet of CTL's curricular program, one that is particularly robust during this year's fall curriculum. Students learn more deeply when they have a practical, hands-on experience that relates to whatever topic is being discussed and researched in the classroom. The classroom is a space where we build up our knowledge and our skills so that our field experiences are most productive.\
\
When I was a student, field trips often came at the end of the learning, like a prize where we saw what we had already learned about. These days, in progressive schools where educators plan curriculum according to research about how brains work, field experiences look different. They often take place early in a study to launch curiosity. Students go out into the world to meet experts in their places of work and get information in context. At CTL, we are often able to go one step further and involve students in collecting data for authentic participation in scientific research. Field experiences are an integral part of how learning takes place in the studentsâ€™ brains.\

This year's science theme is Water: Fresh and Salt, and students have visited the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Reid State Park, Burnt Island, and Porter Preserve in just the past two weeks. It's been exciting to have students collaborate with Dr. Marissa McMahan, learning about crabs (invasive and native) and the intertidal zone, and to participate in [Project ASCO](https://schoodicinstitute.org/science/marine-ecology-research/latest-projects/project-asco-assessing-seaweed-via-community-observations/) through the Schoodic Insitute. I've really enjoyed learning from the kids about weighing rockweed. A special thanks to Eni's dad, John Burns, for accompanying us on our trip to Reid, showing us how to use the microscopes, and helping us look for plankton in the water.\
\
Our history theme this year is Early Americans & Making A Nation. On Tuesday we will partner with Louise and Jeffrey Miller of the Lincoln County Historical Association for a trip to Colonial Pemaquid, where they will provide information through re-enactment and historical artifact examination about the early fisheries, colonial settlements, and colonists interactions with the Wabanaki. We'll learn more about the Wabanaki with trips to the Farnsworth and Coastal Rivers in the next month.

Providing students with these learning opportunities takes help from parents and we are so grateful to everyone who is taking time off or rearranging their schedules to make these trips away from campus possible. As discussed at the Curriculum Nights, if you are a parent who needs extended lead time to join field experiences, please reach out to Sarah to get the advance dates and volunteer. We hope many parents will join our field experiences this year and also that parents will come here to our home base and tell the students about what you do, professionally, out in your field.

You are truly appreciated.Keep exploring!Love, Katy
