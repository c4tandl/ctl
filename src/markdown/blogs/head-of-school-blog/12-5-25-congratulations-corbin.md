Corbin, known here at CTL as a most amazing artist and storyteller, will now get the worldwide recognition he deserves! His Alligators Anthology has been purchased by Holiday House/Neal Porter Books and will be published in the fall of 2027.



Corbin made the initial dummy featuring the summertime adventures of senior citizen alligators Geraldine and Alfonso when the current 3-4 class was with him two years ago. They gave him lots of advice about the story and fell in love with those alligators just like you will when you read the upcoming book. Working with his editor, Taylor Norman, Corbin developed the initial picture book into a four season anthology of stories about Geraldine and Alphonso’s friendship and their adventures together over the course of a year. 



In a letter, Taylor described the book’s “idiosyncratic and wry and precise language” as a humorous feature that drew her into the world. She also complimented Corbin’s “intuition about the intricacies of friendship,” a quality he definitely possesses and makes good use of here in his role as first and second grade teacher. 



We’re proud to call Corbin one of our own faculty, excited for him about this opportunity, and waiting impatiently to see the book! Nothing could keep Corbin from drawing – sometimes I save his agenda pages at the end of faculty meeting because they have blossomed with amazing creations – and we hope he’ll continue sharing his art and his ideas with all of us each day. Thanks for being you, Corbin!
