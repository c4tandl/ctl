1/5/24 - Goal Setting

Hello, CTL People, 

Happy New Year! I've been thinking about resolutions and what the difference is between a resolution and a goal. Perhaps it's just a semantic difference, but I have been picturing the way students grow and making parallels. And thinking about how goals seem easier to achieve than resolutions in my own life. 

At CTL, our kids identify specific ways in which they would like to grow (with teacher consultation) and then they regularly achieve just what they set out to. So how come kids can do that, but so many of us grownups may have trouble sticking with our resolutions in the new year? 

There are myriad important possible differences (especially between child and adult learners), but I believe that the educational practice of breaking a larger goal into specific steps helps significantly. Kids at CTL don't just have a goal, they have a plan with steps to achieve what they have identified. Feedback and reflections help too - CTL students hear every day from attentive grownups and peers about what they are doing well and they are openly encouraged to feel pride. Also, CTL kids take the time to record their work in portfolios, with pictures, etc., so even during a moment when they might doubt their progress, there is usually ample evidence of growth to buoy them up.

If you have resolved something in this new year, consider taking some tips from the kids.

(1. Small steps 2. Coaching 3. Evidence)

They most certainly know how to change and grow gracefully! 



Enjoy the snow this weekend and keep in touch,
