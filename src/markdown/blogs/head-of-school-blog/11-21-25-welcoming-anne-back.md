Dear CTL Families, 



I am excited to announce a major strategic step forward for CTL. Beginning next month, Anne Atwell Merkel will join CTL as the school’s first Assistant Head of School. 

Welcome back, Anne! 



Anne brings deep knowledge of the school to the newly developed position. Anne attended CTL for nine years as a student, from 1991-2000. She returned to CTL in 2013 to teach 7-8 Humanities, thriving in the middle school for nine years and also taking on the administrative role of Lead Teacher (responsible for faculty evaluation, meetings, communications, and the annual appeal) for several years. Anne has served on CTL’s Board of Directors for the past eleven years, recently leading the committees on Curriculum and Professional Reach. Anne has been known to refer to CTL as her sibling, and her love for and knowledge of the school reflect the care we show our closest family, certainly. 



In the past four years, she’s worked in nonprofit administration, primarily for Girls on the Run as Program Manager, where she was responsible for leading programming, outreach, and training for a positive youth development organization that partners with over 70 schools and communities across Maine.



Anne brings myriad strengths to this new role. She is organized, kind, persistent, intelligent, and deeply committed to CTL’s mission. The Assistant Head of School will wear many hats, as we all do in a small non-profit, but the initial plan is for Anne to focus on alumni, interns, curricular initiatives, faculty coaching, event planning, and press/social media. 



I am so excited about working with Anne again on a daily basis and very grateful to CTL’s Board of Directors for supporting this strategic opportunity for CTL.  I love this school and I do my best to be present for kids and teachers each day while also planning and thinking strategically about the future. Often, I leave school in the afternoon with many goals left incomplete, ready to move to tomorrow’s list. Sometimes that doesn’t feel great. I believe that with Anne’s help, Louise, Sarah, and I will be able to work more efficiently and effectively. I believe that her presence will not just move specific initiatives forward, but will potentially increase longevity for all of CTL’s administration. (In other words, I am not going anywhere! This is just a major supportive boon for the school and for me and I am ecstatic!)



We will hold a welcome session for Anne after school on December 4, from 3:00-4:15. Please register for aftercare with Sarah; there is no charge for aftercare if you are attending the meet and greet for Anne. At the meeting, families will have the opportunity to meet and introduce themselves to Anne and she will be seeking parent input about what is working really well at CTL and listening for potential initiatives for the future. I encourage you to please attend, as these opportunities for connection are crucial to the continued strengthening of our community. 

Thanks for reading and I hope you will join me in welcoming Anne back with open arms! 

Love, 

Katy
