title: CTL Head of School Blog
---
Welcome to my Head of School blog. I’ve collected articles I wrote for CTL’s weekly newsletter below. I selected the articles below because I believe they may be of interest to prospective families or others. They attempt to address the “why” of CTL’s educational practices and they explain the school’s philosophy as it applies to daily life in the classrooms. I hope that they spark your interest in the work students and teachers are doing at school each day, and that you remain curious about the Center for Teaching and Learning.
