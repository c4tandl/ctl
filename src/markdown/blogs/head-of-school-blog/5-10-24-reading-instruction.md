5/10/24 - Reading Instruction

Dear CTL Families,\
In 2017, CTL was recognized by the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. The school received a prestigious Literacy Award for Reading Instruction. CTL’s work with our students and also with intern teachers was acknowledged as having a powerful and long-lasting impact on our constituents. 

CTL develops many aspects of reading instruction particularly well. CTL creates a culture of readers and reading that permeates every aspect of school life, and even extends into our students' homes, as every CTL parent will tell you. Kids at CTL regularly discuss favorite books, making and taking recommendations in the cubby room and on the playground as well as in the classroom. Students know their favorite genres and authors, what kinds of plots or worlds excite them, and when/why to put a book down. They have not just one time and place for reading (bedtime) but many. (A quick survey suggests: car, before dinner, when I wake up, to my dog, while I’m waiting, at the table, ANYTIME!) 

From the start, CTL’s instruction in phonics and word study has many entrance points for students because of the use of poetry for embedded instruction. Throughout the grades, using poetry as a shared text impacts students’ ability to discuss authorial intent, voice, craft, and to respond personally to words on the page. 

CTL makes time for students to read in school, as many schools do. Differently from some “silent” reading times found elsewhere, during reading, CTL teachers conference with individuals, getting to know each reader in their class quite personally. These conferences allow the teacher to provide direct and individualized feedback about a range of areas, from fluency to book choice to thematic content.

Each CTL teacher has developed practices around reading instruction that have influenced classes of students and also the interns who come to CTL to learn. Ideas and practices developed here at CTL have spread even further through Nancie’s books In The Middle and Naming the World, Nancie and Anne’s book specifically about reading practices, The Reading Zone, and Helene Coffin’s book, Every Child a Reader. Other teachers have published articles and presented their work at conferences. 

Last week, I was invited to represent CTL and the school’s reading practices at the Library of Congress’s east coast gathering of the past ten years of Literacy Award winners. I enjoyed meeting other winners, learning about the missions of their organizations, and hearing about the impact their work is making in their communities. I participated in panel discussions about partnerships in expanding literacy education, use of materials, and communications. I had the opportunity to interact with Board members for the Literacy Awards and discuss how the Library is interested in continuing to support past winners who find new ways to expand their reach. The day-long experience was exhilarating and I felt proud to talk about CTL’s reading program and our circles of impact. 

I hope that during this busy spring season, we all have time to settle down with a good book (my current recommendation is Wandering Stars) or at least that, when we see one of our kiddos curled up reading, we pause and smile. 

Take care and keep in touch, 

Katy
