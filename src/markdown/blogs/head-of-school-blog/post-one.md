9/22/23 - Teacher Professional Development

Hello, CTL People, 

Monday’s teacher professional day saw extensive collaboration and reflection, two hallmarks of CTL at the student and the teacher level. Because CTL’s methods and approaches are based on research, what we design for student learning is often mirrored at the adult level as well. 

Collaboration: Teachers spent the morning collaboratively designing and refining the all-school history and science curriculum. Many CTL explorations for students require kids to share their ideas, work as a team, revise their initial understanding, and work together toward a collaborative goal or outcome. The teachers do the same when working together because we know better outcomes result from multiple thinkers providing a variety of lenses and ideas.\
\
Reflection: Research suggests that growth is most strongly tied to goal-setting and self-reflection. Many types of reflection offer opportunities for revision, from peer conversation to journaling. Students review evidence of both their process and their products when making their portfolios, and reflect in their self-evaluations as they plan for their presentations. Teachers set goals for themselves and make plans for reflection through research, writing, and collegial conversation throughout the year. The adult and student design mirror because research shows it as the most efficient path toward self-motivated growth. 

We hope that the recent Curriculum Nights have also set the stage for both collaboration and reflection with families, in true partnership as we both focus on student growth. 

We appreciate parents understanding that teachers need time to collaborate, plan, and reflect together. In the same way that we take student ideas very seriously, we deeply value the ways that CTL teachers are respected as thoughtful professionals. Thank you for supporting our practices.

Take care and keep in touch,\
Katy
