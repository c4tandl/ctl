Hello, CTL Families, 

I’m excited to highlight an upcoming event that may be of interest to your family, our Alumni Panel. 

On Monday, January 26, at 6:00 we’ll invite the community to connect with high school- and college-age alumni on Zoom to hear them reflect on their transition from CTL to high school, their experience there, and, for some, their further transitions and experiences. At this time, we know that we will have a mix of public and independent schools represented, with CTL alums who went on to attend Lincoln Academy, Boothbay Region High School, Morse High School, Waynflete, and Baxter Academy for Technology and Science joining us. We have also invited alums from several other schools and hope they will also be on the call. 

We invite parents and students of any age to attend this Zoom meeting, although older students may understand most clearly the transition being discussed. 

Here are a few questions we'll ask; we'll also take questions from the audience at the end. 



What do you think is a strength CTL students have in the high school environment (or beyond)?

How was the transition to a larger school?  How did you manage?

What words of advice would you share with a recent CTL graduate about to start high school?



RSVP to Sarah if you plan to attend.
