Dear CTL People,

The school was so honored to have a visit from Secretary of State Shenna Bellows on Thursday as part of the history curriculum. Students have been studying the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the three branches of government. Hearing from a state-level politician helped deepen our understanding of government as present day - a live and active aspect of life as a Mainer.



Shenna spoke at Morning Meeting about her responsibilities as Secretary of State and also the path that led her from kindergarten to state government. She caught everyone’s attention talking about her role managing Maine’s archive, impressing us with the large number of boxes of state records, 65,000! She told a poignant story about being in kindergarten and wanting to answer “President of the United States” when asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, but instead conforming with other classmates and saying, “teacher” and then being very upset about having lied to her teacher. So she knew from the start that she was on a path to lead and to help people. Shenna discussed her role in making sure everyone who is over 18 and a citizen in Maine can vote. She modeled the kind of cross-aisle civility we need in government, talking about her office as non-partisan and her role as not telling people how to vote but making sure that they have the opportunity to share their opinion. She discussed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and the registry for corporations that her office leads and oversees. 



It was exciting to hear her talk about how proud she is of Maine being in the top three states of voters per capita and being the number one state for people ages 18-24 voting in 2024. It made me feel proud of Maine too, and I spent hours yesterday speculating about the factors of Maine life that might promote civic responsibility or empower young people. 



After Morning Meeting, Shenna joined the 7-8 class for their first block, answering questions the students had crafted after researching her role and her personal history in government. I was proud of our students as they asked about issues they care deeply about, from the government shutdown to transgender students in sports, from funding for STEM initiatives to ICE in Maine. And then they also asked about her favorite ice cream.  And I loved how Shenna was so calm and even-toned, but also said some really firm and strong opinions that I know not everyone agrees with. She was so clearly “saying what she believes and thinks is right,” to quote from CTL’s own Bill of Rights. 



Our Bill of Rights interested Shenna and we were excited to share it with her. She spoke right away with students about her interest in “the right to be yourself” and the value of freedom of speech. 



Personally, I left my interactions with her feeling inspired by her honesty, her openness, and her ability to connect with different aged students. I had tears in my eyes several times listening to her speak plainly about her beliefs. Representation matters, as Angela said to the teachers at lunch, and we were glad to have kids’ early idea of what a government official looks like be a smiling woman. I am grateful for her visit and honored that she chose CTL as a place to spend her time.

Take care and keep in touch, 

Katy
