Dear CTL Families,

Since coming on board as CTL’s Assistant Head of School, it’s been a privilege to think more deeply about CTL’s alumni and ways that we can celebrate and learn from the folks who once sang songs at Morning Meeting, cruised down the sledding hill, and published poetry in Acorns the way our current students do. 



It was a true highlight of this past week to invite eight graduates of CTL to join us for an Alumni/Next Schools Panel on Monday evening. These alums represented a variety of different high school experiences and interests and ranged in age from high school sophomore to college junior. All of them shared reflections on their CTL education and advice about the transition to high school that was wise, compassionate, vulnerable, kind, witty, and insightful. Thank you to our amazing panelists.



We were thrilled to have many current families join us for the Zoom panel—especially on the evening of a snow day!—and we believe many others, with kids of all ages, will find the recording of the discussion valuable viewing. Current middle schoolers in particular may appreciate the words shared: truly like advice you would get from a group of very thoughtful, savvy, caring older siblings.





As we continue to engage with our alumni, and to think ahead to CTL’s 35th Birthday Celebration on May 16th, we are reaching out with an Alumni Survey. We’re making sure we have the most up to date contact information for our graduates across the decades: to connect around the 35th party and to stay in close touch about ways that CTL can serve these important members of our community. If you are an alumni, alum parent, or former faculty/staff member reading this, please fill out the quick survey here. If you are in touch with anyone who fits that description, please help us by forwarding the link to them. 



We look forward to continuing to connect the past and present of CTL as we move into the future of teaching and learning here on Cross Point Road.



Anne
