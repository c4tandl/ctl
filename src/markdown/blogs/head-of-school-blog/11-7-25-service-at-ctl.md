Hello, CTL Families, 

This week, we are giving the newsletter article over to Eugenia Gallagher and Abi Iverson, who have run a service auxiliary program at CTL for the past two years. The students' learning in this afterschool experience also comes into the school day as they teach classmates about organizations and get wider support for projects, and we plan to expand service further during this year.

Service Auxiliary Update

Hello everyone, I wanted to report on another fun trimester for the Service Auxiliary! We did some really fun things this fall.

Our first week we learned about Carl the Collector (a kids show about friendship on PBS) and helped make signs about friendship and belonging for the related event happening during Pumpkinfest at Coastal Kids Preschool.

The only other day we stayed at CTL was spent making cat toys for Midcoast Humane. We used old socks, toilet paper rolls, feathers, catnip, and some other supplies. There were some amazing creations, and the kids really spent time considering what the kitties would most enjoy!

For those of you who have visited the children's area at Skidompha Library, you may be familiar with the craft packets they have available to take home. We spent one service day putting together Carl-themed craft packets for them! I was amazed at how many we got done and how quickly! The kids really worked hard.

Another week we spent some time at Hannafords picking out items for the Help Yourself Shelf at the CLC YMCA and talking about hunger in our community. We thought about what staples are always welcome and we also picked out a few special favorites the kids wanted to share.

We visited Lincoln Home in mid-October, and Edgecomb Green just this week, and made some fun crafts together with the residents. It is always so wonderful to connect with these two groups of older adults in our community. Now that we have been running this program for over a year, there is a feeling of ease and familiarity on our visits - we are really making friends and that is what this is all about!

One sunny afternoon was spent tromping through the Marsh River Preserve, another activity we have done almost every trimester as we try to keep up maintenance on our adopted trail. The kids are armed with clippers and spend their time clipping back seedlings and branches that are encroaching on the trail, moving any sticks or other obstacles off the trail, and taking note of any larger issues that might need attention from Midcoast Conservancy.

We visited Laurie at Wiscasset Library right before Halloween, and after making some really great cards for the veterans at Togus Medical Center, we got to carve a pumpkin for the library! Laurie is so welcoming every time we visit and we love connecting with this little beautiful library right near school.

Thanks so much to the kids for all their hard work and time spent engaging! We are looking forward to more fun in the winter!

Eugenia
