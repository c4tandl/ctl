 Mateo Alacran, known as El Patron, rules a small stretch of poppy fields between United States and Mexico, the futuristic country of Opium.  In Opium, things are run far different from anywhere else.  El Patron, a drug lord, is selfish and cruel because anything that he possesses, becomes his forever.  Whether the possession is a person or a useless object, it will remain his to the grave.  In Nancy Farmer’s future, clones are considered to be scum, lower than animals, and are not welcome anywhere because when a clone is made its brain is damaged forever because of the crude law.  Matteo’s life is saved, and he is forced to set out to live as normally he can while being a clone.<br />Mateo Alacran, the clone of El Patron, is forced to live his life in Opium where he is ignored, hated, and shunned by everyone except for his “father,” El Patron, his adopted mother Celia, and trusty bodyguard Tam Lin.  The only reason Mat is not banned or enslaved from Opium is because of El Patron’s orders to protect Mat.  But how long will those orders stay true?  Mat is confused why clones are hated and determined to find his destiny.  Can Mat survive in a place where he is hated?  Is their a place where he will be accepted as a normal boy, or is he destined to live his life forever thought of as a dirty clone?  Why does he exist in the first place?<br />Nancy Farmer does an amazing job of creating a problem so intriguing that you are forced to read on.  She adds the thoughts and feelings of Mat and great description of Opium and its rules.  The people of Opium are so different from our world now that you have to pay close attention to everything that happens or you will be lost.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys action, suspense, and mystery because you will love figuring out the purpose of Mat’s existence alongside of him.  For example, when Mat sees a brain damaged clone, he wonders how he can be a clone too and thoughts cloud his brain.  You experience all his thoughts and clues to solving the mystery with him.  Nancy Farmer creates such a crude and unfair future with many twists and turns you will be intrigued to read more and won’t be able to put this book down until Mat is safe along with the people of Opium and the rest of this future world.  In this amazing book, Nancy Farmer teaches about friendship, loyalty, and what it means to risk everything to right the wrongs of the world even if you’re only a clone, powerless and never meant to be.<br />Eloise<br />
