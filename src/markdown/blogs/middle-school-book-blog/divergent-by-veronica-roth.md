<p>Futuristic
Chicago is split into five factions. Each&nbsp; one is designed to maintain a
happy, healthy, hard working community that balances all of the strong human
traits. Sixteen-year-old Beatrice Prior has lived in Abnegation her whole life;
they're the faction that values selflessness above everything else. Now,
Beatrice has the opportunity to decide her own fate, and choose which faction
she truly belongs to. But when her aptitude test goes wrong, Beatrice discovers
that she is in great danger and has a big decision to make.&nbsp; Will she
choose selfless Abnegation and stay with her family and all she’s ever known?
Or should Beatrice betray her family and her faction, and choose one of the
other four? It’s faction before blood, after all. Beatrice makes a decision
that leads to some terrifying, nerve wracking, and suspenseful moments, all to
find out where she really belongs.</p>

<p>Veronica Roth creates a dystopian novel with constant suspense, each chapter fast-paced and exciting. Readers will find themselves wondering what faction they would belong in, right along with Beatrice, who now goes by “Tris”. Each page has strong sensory diction, making it easy for the reader to follow along and imagine all of the unexpected buildings, people and places in this futuristic world. Roth writes in a dramatic tone, which adds to the plot and will have the reader wondering, <em>What’s next? </em>Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and the reader might be completely unsure of what could happen in the coming chapter. </p>

<p>Tris will surprise at every step of the way.

<p>This leads into the theme of <em>Divergent, </em>which explores how humans act, and how no one fits into one category. Tris is unsteady and unsure of herself, but as the book goes on, the reader will realize along with Tris that she does not have just one trait. She has lots of important qualities that make her who she is, which she will realize eventually. Readers will follow along with Tris as she makes friends and enemies for the first time, falls in love, and learns just how imperfect her society is.</p>

<p>I rated this book a 10 out of 10 and enjoyed every detail and description. There are two other books in this trilogy, <em>Insurgent</em> and <em>Allegiant</em>, and I am sure they will be as thrilling as <em>Divergent.</em> I would recommend this book to anyone ages eleven and older, because there are a few gory scenes. Anyone who enjoys suspense, friendship, and dramatic and dangerous scenes will love this book. You will empathize with Tris for her daring and kind personality, and completely enjoy her perspective.</p>
