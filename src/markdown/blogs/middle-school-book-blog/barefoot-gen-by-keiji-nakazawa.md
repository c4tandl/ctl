 I loved this amazing book, <em>Barefoot Gen </em>by Keiji Nakazawa. It’s a graphic novel about a city in Japan called Hiroshima, during World War II, when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end the war. This story is about a young boy named Gen and his family and how they deal with the nuclear annihilation.<br />I think <em>Barefoot Gen</em> was as graphic novel because not only can we read the visuals, thoughts and feelings, and actions, from the character’s perspectives, but we can look at the  great, descriptive drawings. These allowed me to see everything at a completely different level than if it was prose. They’re also a reason I rated this book a ten out of ten.<br /><em>Barefoot Gen</em> is a book with many important themes: survival, death, and the importance of family. But it’s also about having courage and faith in yourself and realizing that no matter how bad a situation is, we have to deal with it and make the best of it.<br />This was a very quick read for me, because there was always one exciting thing after another and it kept me guessing on the future of the book, both plot and character wise. The lead was not what I expected, because the actual attack happens near the end, there are two sequels that describe the aftermath of the bombing.<br />I would recommend <em>Barefoot Gen</em> to anyone who likes a fast-paced read, along with an adventure, along with a true but horrific story about this famous event.<br />Nathaniel<br />
