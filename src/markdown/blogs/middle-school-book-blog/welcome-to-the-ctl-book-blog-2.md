<p>You Gotta Read This! features book reviews written by CTL seventh- and eighth-grade students about books they have loved and think other middle school readers would love, too. All reviews are written by the kids in writing workshop, based on titles that they’ve selected and adored in reading workshop. The reviews are posted chronologically–extending back to 2009–tagged according to genre, and added to each year.</p>
