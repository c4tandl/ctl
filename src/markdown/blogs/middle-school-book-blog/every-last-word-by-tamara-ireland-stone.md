<p><em>“You start being kind to yourself, making decisions that are best for you, not best for everyone else. You look around at the people in your life, one by one, choosing to hold on to the ones who make you stronger and better, and letting go of the ones who don’t.” </em></p>

<p>Samantha McAllister might seem like a normal highschool girl, but something people don’t know is that she has obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which fills her with anxiety and rapid thoughts, when all she wants to do is focus on fitting in with the popular group. But one day, she meets a girl named Caroline who introduces her to a place called Poet’s Corner: a secret and hidden room in the back of their school, where a group of students go every week to write poetry and encourage one another to embrace ways of expressing themselves through writing. By surrounding herself with a new community, Samantha finds herself curious about a boy named AJ who seems very familiar. Could she finally overcome her fears from just a small bit of change, or will Poet’s Corner become a bigger deal in her life than she expects?  </p>

<p><em>Every Last Word</em> was a touching and beautiful story because of how easily Tamara Ireland Stone grasped the concept of finding oneself within the daily challenges of being a teenager, while at the same time taking a realistic approach to the struggles someone deals with when having a mental disorder. I loved how Stone could write a book about literature as an art form, and how it can help people survive tough moments in their lives without realizing it.</p>

<p>In the very beginning of the book, Stone includes a flashback of Samantha handling an OCD attack when she was young. I found this effective because I was able to understand who the lead character was and the struggles she was facing in advance of when the plot line started. Whenever the setting changed, Stone always knew how to use the right words to captivate her audience into different moments. The word choices throughout the book always had a purpose, and the depth of the story was complex but easily understandable. I found it interesting how I could learn important life lessons—not just through the protagonist’s experiences, but from how Stone incorporated them metaphorically for the readers, too.</p>

<p>I find it best when a realistic fiction book is written in first person  because it makes personal moments more relatable for me. Stone provided this perspective for her readers, which gave me a better glimpse of Samantha's thoughts and how they were triggering her to act around other characters.</p>

<p>The pace of this novel was perfect. It moved along steadily without jumping to conclusions too quickly. Each chapter was unpredictable. Stone knew how to bring excitement to her audience by making the tone appear non-suspenseful. This seemed to catch me more off guard when the plot <em>would</em> turn. I definitely recommend reading until the end, because the conclusion left me stunned. </p>

<p>Overall, this story was inspirational and gifted me with a whole new perspective on the world around me. I have realized how much other people’s lives affect our own because of how we silently learn from one another each day. Samantha taught me that we don’t just build each other up with our voices and actions, but with the experiences we have as a society, too. I rate this book a ten out of ten and at some point, I hope everyone is able to read this novel about a girl’s life, which will change yours for the better.  </p>
