<p>Sage is a baker struggling
with her mother’s death: alone in the world until she meets Josef, an elderly
man in her grief group. They strike up an unlikely friendship, but everything
changes when he asks her for an impossible favor and confesses who he really
is—not the Little League coach and retired teacher as everyone assumes, but a
former Nazi SS Guard. With her view of this man completely changed and her
grandmother a Holocaust survivor, she must decide what to do about the favor he
asked—one that may have legal consequences if she grants it but personal ones
if she doesn’t—and whether to forgive him or give her grandmother the revenge
she deserves. </p>

<p>This gripping novel
by Jodi Picoult from told in five perspectives. It starts with just Sage, and
the others come in when their characters are introduced and wind around her
perspective. I thought this was effective because it allows Sage to be the main
character and her story to be in the foreground, but it also gives the reader
all the background information and additional stories to make the plot more
interesting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another effective
aspect of the distinct perspectives is that each is in a different font. This
is helpful because, since the perspectives usually last around twenty pages,
the fonts make it easy to know which one you are reading if you flip to a
random page. I thought the length of these narratives was effective because the
reader has time to really get into each one, but they aren’t so long that the audience
forgets other pieces of the story. They are also all told in first person voice,
which I think allows the audience to have a deep connection to each character.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that Picoult successfully withholds information, such as Josef’s real name and who the fifth perspective is. I found this effective because it keeps the reader wanting to read on to find the missing information. The perspectives also change at critical moments in the characters’ stories, which adds to the suspenseful tone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Picoult meaningfully
incorporates many genres, including historical fiction, realistic fiction,
survival, and touches of fantasy and romance. This makes this book accessible for
everyone, and although the historical and survival aspects were my favorite,
the others added nice touches to the story, and I found myself enjoying them as
well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would rate this
book a ten out of ten for its well-developed characters and captivating plot
line, and I would recommend it to everyone twelve and over. So what are you
waiting for? Go grab a copy and prepare for a phenomenal read that you just
can’t put down.</p>
