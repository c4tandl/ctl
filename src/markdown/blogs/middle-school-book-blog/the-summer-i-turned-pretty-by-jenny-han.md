<em> The summer i turned pretty</em> by Jenny Han is a fantastic novel that I devoured in a day.  I was caught up in the story from page one because of Han’s characters, dialogue, and storyline.  Through all 276 pages, I was hooked.<br />Every summer in fifteen-year-old Belly’s life has led up to this one.  This is going to be the unforgettable summer, and there isn’t a better place to spend it than at the beach house Belly has visited every summer, with her brother Steven and mother.  Belly’s mom and the owner of the beach house—Susannah—have been best friends for years.  Susanna’s two sons, Jeremiah and Conrad, have known Belly since her first summer.  Jeremiah has grown to be her friend, while Conrad, older, has always been her crush.  During a season filled with the confusions, loves, and changes of teenagers, everything takes a twist.<br />The characters in <em>the summer i turned pretty</em> are unforgettable.  They come alive for the reader and are just plain loveable.  The personalities of each character and how they communicate with one another is very realistic.  They talk and act like teenagers do today.<br />Jenny Han is a fantastic new author who more girls should know about.  Her writing can be compared to Sarah Dessen’s, while having a style all her own.  Han’s first book was <em>Shug</em>, and while not as good as <em>the summer i turned pretty</em>, it’s also  a great novel that young adult readers will eat up.<br />The conclusion to <em>the summer i turned pretty</em> is both satisfying and strong.  It ends how the reader wants it to—whether we knew it or not—without being predictable or corny.  This is an over-the-weekend read and one that any twelve- to fifteen-year-old girl will devour at least once.  I have read <em>and </em>reread it—it’s a ten!<br />Abbey<br />
