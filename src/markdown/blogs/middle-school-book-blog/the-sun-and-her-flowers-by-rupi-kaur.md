<p>When I first picked up Rupi
Kaur’s <em>the sun and her flowers</em>, I was skeptical about whether I would
like it at all. The fact that it was a poetry collection and centered around
Kaur’s experience with love made me think it might be boring and unrelatable. I
wasn't interested in reading a book without a traditional plot and characters to
follow through their hurdles and harrowing adventures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But once I looked through
the book, I realized how captivating Kaur’s poetry really is. Her short stanzas
capture the devastation of her immigrant experience, the shame of being a
woman, and the anger and loss in her love.  I found Kaur inspiring as a
powerful woman and poet who could simultaneously express the vulnerability she
has experienced. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stanzas are short and
cut to the bone, using only the most important feelings and ideas. This leaves
the reader with a strong mental image without having to uncover it from
unnecessary thoughts or actions. Kaur also rarely uses punctuation in the
middle of her poems, which I found made the cadence and rhythm powerful,
expressing the individuality of each line. Together with the carefully planned
line breaks, this shows how strong Kaur’s formatting and structuring is, and
makes the words sound like they are her direct thoughts she is allowing the
reader to access.</p>

<p>Kaur perfectly balances
defeat, loss, and pain, with a powerful sense of self-worth and love; I felt
like I could relate to every poem. Her work encouraged me to divulge personal
meanings and struggles from her writing. Kaur’s poems stood up for women in a
realistic way, drawing upon her personal experiences to vividly describe real
issues women face today. Even though they were sometimes hard to read, because
of her honesty and realistic storytelling, I found her poems to be inspiring
and empowering. </p>

<p><em>The sun and her flowers</em> is separated into five parts: <em>wilting</em>,<em>
falling</em>,<em> rooting</em>,<em> rising</em>, and<em> blooming</em>. I thought it
was strong to use a metaphor of the flower to describe herself. These
separations helped give some shape to the collection that better described her
love and the pain she felt. Each piece also has rough sketches around the poem.
I felt like the drawing told its own story, and added more depth to her poetry.
They were so powerful, even without the words- they seemed so personal to her
and her story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> All of Kaur’s poems are timely for our society
today and promote power to immigrants, woman, and minorities. Her work shows
the power Kaur found in her vulnerability, and how writing can help you find
courage like it did for her.</p>
