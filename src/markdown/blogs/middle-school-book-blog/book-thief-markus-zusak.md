 Liesel Meminger is a girl living in Nazi Germany, who learns to read with the help of her adoptive father. She steals books for more to read when her family, the Hubermanns, takes in Max Vandenburg, a Jewish man on the run from the Nazis. Liesel’s best friend, Rudy Steiner, convinces Liesel to join a band of teenage thieves who steal apples from farmers for food and helps her through many tough situations. The aforementioned Max is my favorite character due to his role and involvement in Liesel's growing up.<br />I rated this book a ten out of ten because Zusak created such a rich and descriptive world with strong narration and characters. The strength of this book was in the little details Zusak used to paint pictures in your head, such as when Max would imagine boxing with Hitler. This could have been cut, and doing so might have made the book shorter, but not as powerful.<br />This book isn't for readers who dislike sad novels. One of the literary techniques that Zusak uses is having death as a narrator. This choice helps represent such a dark and ghastly time. I recommend this book to ages ten and up due to the sad topic and story. However, the  theme was friendship after all the friendships that occur throughout the book and the important roles they play for the characters.<br />This was one of my binge reads. I was hooked from the first paragraph:<br /><em>First the colors.</em><br /><em>Then the humans.</em><br /><em>That’s how I see things.</em><br /><em>Or at least how, I try.</em><br /><em>* * *<strong> HERE IS A SMALL FACT </strong>* * *</em><br /><strong><em>You are going to die.</em></strong><br />This quote shows the strength of having Death narrate the book and the straightforwardness of his storytelling style.<br />I loved every page of this novel. The moment I finished this it was in my top three books. This book is life changing. It will make you change how you think about the Holocaust and the world.<br />Liam<br />Alfred A. Knopf. 552 pages.
