<em> Say Goodnight, Gracie </em>is the story of Gracie and Jimmy, who have had an unbreakable friendship almost since birth.  Gracie's life is nearly perfect--until, one cold winter evening, a drunk driver kills Jimmy.  The rest of the novel is about how Gracie tries to fit in with the world now that her best friend is gone.  Gracie's psychiatrist aunt helps her as much as she can, but nothing can fill the gap in Gracie's heart that once belonged to Jimmy.  In the end, Gracie discovers that she has to overcome her tragic loss if she ever wants to be happy again.<br />I adored this book. The lead was grabbing, so I was intrigued right from the first paragraph.  It was funny because of the realistic dialogue; sad, because of Jimmy's death; and uplifting, because of its conclusion.  It was pure pleasure to read.<br />I was disappointed when the novel ended, because I wanted to continue reading this clever and well-written story.  I finished <em>Say Goodnight, Gracie</em> over a weekend because I couldn't bear to part with a great main character, and now I wish I had savored it.  I just couldn't stop reading.  This book is well-qualified to be rated a ten or higher.<br />Abbey<br />Publisher:  HarperTeen, 224 pages<br />
