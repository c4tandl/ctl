 This story focuses on a boy whose name is Martin.  He discovers that his friends have special abilities: his roommate can set things on fire, another friend can read minds, another can see four minutes into the future, and yet another can “hear” lost objects.  He says they call to him and tell him where they are.  The last, to me, is the most interesting. This boy, it seems, has the force from Star Wars.  He can move things without touching them, and he can break things just as easily.  But it’s Martin who detects these “hidden talents.”  At first his friends don’t believe him, but soon they become aware that they do, indeed, have unusual powers.<br />This novel has amazing visuals, and the dialogue is fantastic.  I personally chose to take my time with this it because I enjoy reading to a spot that I know I will want to come back to. This wasn’t hard to do with<em> Hidden Talents</em>.  It is written in first person, which, for me, makes it easier to follow, as does the fact that it’s written in present tense instead of past.  The lead and plot are really cliffhangers, but the conclusion is very satisfying. This book is definitely a ten, no doubt about it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who read and liked the <em>Heir Trilogy</em> by Cinda Williams Chima.  David Lubar has also written <em>Dunk</em>,<em> Sleeping Freshman (Never Lie</em>), and a   sequel to <em>Hidden Talents</em>, entitled <em>True Talents.</em> There are changes in narrative in the sequel, which makes it kind of confusing because the chapters about the main character are written in first person, but the chapters written about his friends are in third person.  Compared to <em>Hidden Talents</em>, I’d have to rate it a nine.<br />Ben<br />Publisher:  Starscape, 224 pages<br />
