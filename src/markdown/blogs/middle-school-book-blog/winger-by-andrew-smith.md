<p>In <em>Winger
</em>by Andrew Smith, Ryan Dean West is a fourteen-year-old junior at Pine
Mountain Academy, who has no trouble in class. This novel is about his
complicated social life. He goes through love, betrayals, and much more, all while
dealing with the corruption of his roommate, Chas Becker, who is constantly
ruining his relationship with his crush, Annie Altman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But those
are not the only characters in <em>Winger, </em>there are more people like Chas
on Ryan Dean’s rugby team that get him to try stuff like alcohol—one of them
being Kevin—which makes Annie very angry with him. There are people like JP,
who was his friend but betrayed him by inviting Annie to dances, parties, and
more. And there are people like Megan who has a crush on Ryan Dean and tries to
sabotage his relationship. Ryan Dean’s social life is all-out warfare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But my
personal favorite part of this book is how Smith developed a deep theme of the
importance of Ryan Dean’s relationships, but at the same time, kept the novel
light-hearted by adding humor wherever he could. For example, Ryan Dean says,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“I’m
sorry for what I did, Chas. I apologize. A guy should never have to go through
the kind of crap I did to you, I know you’re probably still going to kill me
but at least I got that off my chest.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Then I
put out my hand for him, and he shook it.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“You have
guts, winger. But I still hate you.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Fair
enough.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“I hate
you to Chas,” I said, and smiled.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are
a lot of other hilarious parts in the book that are much more funny than this
one, but they may not be appropriate for this book review. This is an ages 14+
book and is not for younger kids because of mature humor and themes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that
out of the way, another conflict Smith included in his novel was to put Ryan
Dean in a complicated setting and place. He lives in Opportunity Hall, or
O-Hall for short, which is the place where the “Bad Kids” go. He got in there
for stealing a teacher's phone, but the issue isn't that he is there, it’s that
actual bad kids are there, like Chas and Kevin. So he is also facing the
corruption of these kids’ attempts to further ruin his social life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, this book is great for a reader who would like to see drama from a boy’s eyes, or wants a deep theme but also to have a good laugh. This book is a ten out of ten, and there is a sequel, <em>Stand Off </em>which continues on to Ryan Dean’s senior year and is even funnier than the first. I hope you enjoy these two books!</p>
