<p>Daniel Altan Wing’s (Day’s) family thinks he is dead. In reality
he is the Republic’s most wanted criminal. After failing his trial to become a
Republic soldier, he is sent off to the labor camps and is expected to die, but
manages to escape. When he returns to his hometown he sees a plague symbol on
his family’s door and takes action. He raids the hospital and, during his
escape, throws a knife at Captain Metias Iparis, allegedly killing him. </p>

<p>June Iparis is the first person ever to score a perfect 1500 on
her trial,  but soon after joining the Republic’s force she finds her
brother, Metias Iparis, dead. Enraged, she starts planning to chase down and
get revenge on Day. During her search, she is dragged into a fight, stabbed,
and taken in by a boy on the street. What she doesn’t realize is that Day is
hiding in plain sight. Will she figure it out? And if she does, what will she
do? </p>

<p>Readers will love the way Marie Lu develops both of the main
characters in this work. In the beginning June is very naïve about the republic
and the world outside of it, but as the story progresses she becomes
increasingly aware of the problems in the world. Day, on the other hand, is
very skeptical of the Republic throughout the entirety of the novel, but as the
book continues he becomes more tuned into the problems outside of the Republic,
as well as the ones inside of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The perspectives switch between a character inside of the
government and a character fighting against it which is an effective feature as
it gives readers the point of view of each side: their opinions and how they
see the issues within their cities and outside of them. Lu also avoided showing
the same scene from each character’s perspective, which let the story continue
at a fast pace and kept the reader engaged throughout  the entire book. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first person narrative  that Lu used was extremely
effective as it helped the reader focus in on the complex issues faced by both
characters in the novel. This also helps readers delve into the minds of the
characters and really understand what is happening in each of their lives at
the moment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lu did a great job of explaining all the rules in the new world of
the Republic within the first few pages so that she could get directly into the
plot of the book. Since the whole novel takes place in a world similar to ours,
but with a much more advanced civilization and a different set of rules for the
citizens, Lu had to teach readers everything about the new world in order for
the plot to be understood. </p>

<p>At the end of this book I found myself rushing into the sequel, Prodigy,
and the final book, Champion. I rated this book a ten out of ten and
would recommend it to fans of <em>Divergent, </em>by Veronica Roth, as there are
some similarities in the plot and genre. Be ready to enter a new world from the
perspectives of June and Day with a gripping plot that will not let you put the
book down.</p>
