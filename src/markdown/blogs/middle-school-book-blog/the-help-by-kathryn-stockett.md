 This book is how I know words can make a difference. <u>The Help</u> by Kathryn Stockett showed me that anyone’s persuasiveness and determination can change a nation or state’s perspective on equal rights.<br />This novel is about a women named Aibileen. She is an African-American maid who lives in the south in the town Jackson, Mississippi during the year 1962. This is when equality between blacks and whites didn’t exist. She takes care of white families. A women named Skeeter Phelan wants to write a book about the life of an African-American maid, And she wants Aibileen to be that women. But Aibileen refuses. While Aibileen tells Skeeter that this book won’t work and isn’t worth it—that the publishers won’t go through with it—Skeeter’s determination to tell people Aibileen’s story skyrockets. Aibileen eventually goes through with it, and they immediately start interviewing.<br />These were the days before the Civil Rights Movement when African Americans and white people didn’t get along. They had riots, and there were no equal rights. The African-Americans had to sit in the back of the bus, or wouldn’t be allowed to sit at the counter of a diner. This is a book that teaches readers that everyone should have equal rights and that no one should be discriminated against because of their race.<br />Skeeter is a great character. She shows her determination and power, and fights to show that all states, especially her own Mississippi, should have equal rights.<br />One day when Skeeter goes to Aibileen’s house to interview her for the book, They are about five minutes into the interview and Skeeter asks a question that Aibileen is not very comfortable with; she just stops talking. Skeeter doesn’t want her to stop, so she tries to persuade her to keep going, but there no budge.<br />As you can see there is a lot of conflict in this book. Among all of the characters and in almost every scene. But as the book progresses… well you’re just going to have to find out.<br />Emma<br />­Berkley, 530 pages
