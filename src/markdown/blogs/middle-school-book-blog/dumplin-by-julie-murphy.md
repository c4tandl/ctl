<p>Willowdean
Dickson is a regular, Dolly Parton-loving girl living in the small town of
Clover City, Texas. People around her comment on her size-even her mom, who
Willowdean does not get along with. Willowdean works at Harpy’s with Bo, who
likes her as more than a friend, though after they kiss she starts to doubt
herself. But when the Miss Teen Bluebonnet Pageant comes along, Willowdean
enters to prove that you don’t have to be perfect to be in a pageant. Along the
way she will discover more about herself and the meaning of friendship.</p>

<p>In <em>Dumplin</em>
Julie Murphy not only developed a strong main character, she crafted amazing
side characters like Millie Millachuck, a girl who wanted to enter the pageant
since she was a  little girl. She has a big personality and is <em>always </em>happy.
All of Murphy's characters have unique stories about their lives, which makes
the book even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>The
themes of <em>Dumplin </em>are the importance of friendship, romance, and being
yourself. Being yourself is very important throughout the book because most of
the characters are figuring out who they are... Murphy made the book perfect
for readers who are learning to be themselves and to never doubt yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One theme that I took away from this book is that friends are important, and they always have your back. Friendship is something that everyone should have, and Willowdean’s friends are the perfect friends: funny, kind and quirky. Murphy made the relationships and friendships seem totally real, so readers can relate to this book, which I think is a key factor that all books should have.</p>

<p>Murphy
also wrote a second book called <em>Puddin, </em>but I wouldn't recommend it. It
was pretty slow moving for me, and even though Millie was one of the characters,
the other girl, Callie Reyas, was not a strong character. Her personality was
the original “girly girl,” which made me frustrated because in <em>Dumplin </em>Murphy
did a really good job. I was not impressed with <em>Puddin</em>.</p>

<p>If
you are a reader who enjoys books that are relatable, fun, and just plain
amazing you have to read this book. The pace of the book is fast. Murphy ends
some of the chapters abruptly, so you will say “just one more chapter.” The
audience for this book is maybe twelve to ... well, any age. It's good for
adults, too. I would rate this incredible book a ten out of ten. I did not
mention this before but this book has been made into a pretty good movie that
surprisingly is kind of like the book but a little less detailed. I recommend
reading the book first because why not?</p>

<p>If you are a romance fan this book would be great for you, it has the perfect amount of romance throughout the book. I hope you read the wonderful <em>Dumplin by </em>Julie Murphy and love it as much as I do.</p>
