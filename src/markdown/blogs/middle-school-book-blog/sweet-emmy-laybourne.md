 Laurel is an average teenage girl—with a wealthy best friend. Tom Forelli is a celebrity who needs to shed his childhood "Baby Tom-Tom" image. The Cruise to Lose is the opportunity of a lifetime for both of them.<br />When the diet drug Solu is created, the company holds a luxury cruise for only the richest of the rich to get a sneak peek at their new, seemingly-magical, sweetener that not only tastes exactly like real sugar, it also helps the eater lose weight. At first, Laurel and Tom's paths cross in a somewhat cliché way (literally running into one another), but their reason for staying in each others' lives is unique: neither has taken Solu, which means neither has experienced the strange symptoms popping up in the rest of the passengers, such as extreme addiction to the point of murder. The passengers get crazier and literally bloodthirsty, including Laurel's best friend, Vivika, and Tom's to-the-public "girlfriend," reality-star Sabbi Ribiero. As the only sober people on the ship, Tom and Laurel unite to put an end to the cruise and take down Solu before it is released to the public.<br />Laybourne switches perspectives between Tom Forelli and Laurel. Because these two characters are so alike in personality but come from contrasting backgrounds, I felt the plot had more dimensions to it. It creates the expectation of predictability in the readers' minds, then goes in a surprising direction. There are twists and turns no reader could expect, giving the novel its breakneck speed.<br />An aspect I particularly loved was how Laybourne packed multiple themes into one book to appeal to multiple audiences. It contained bits of dystopian science-fiction, contemporary realistic fiction, disaster/survival, adventure, and magical realism. Even if you prefer only one of those five genres, Laybourne's way of fusing them together is intriguing and unique: perfect for this novel.<br />Prepare yourself for a book filled-to-the-brim with shocking twists (including a conclusion no one could've foreseen) that you can finish it in a day. <i id="m_1187027463598982133yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1485184261112_5073">Sweet </i>reveals human nature's dark side when we want something badly, but also the beauty of two different personalities working together.<br />Zoe<br />Feiwel and Friends, 272 pages
