Drew Lawson is a senior basketball super star at Baldwin Academy, who is one season away from college. He wants to make senior year his best season yet. In his first three seasons, his team lost in the championships; this time Drew wants to lead his team to the championship title and bring it home. But there is also something stopping this superstar already looking college: his grades. Basketball for him is above and beyond, but his grades haven’t measured up to his athletic super stardom.<br />I love how Walter Dean Myers was so descriptive during games and how the sounds, thoughts, and feelings were detailed enough to make me feel like I was Drew. I also play basketball, so I could see how Drew passed to Ruffy on the post, or Sky set a pick, etc. I could also feel how Drew felt after winning or losing: emotions most readers can connect to. Some other worthwhile books about basketball are Kwame Alexander’s <em>Crossover</em>, a free-verse novel, and Mike Lupica’s <em>Travel Team</em>, a sports-fiction book.<br />Myers’ novel is a quick read, with a lot of basketball time, and a lot of twists which made the book enjoyable, as it bounced among the basketball team, the games and Drew’s family. I enjoyed that Drew was focused on success. He would try to get the best grades he possibly could for two reasons: one, so he could continue to play basketball, and make his mother, father, and sister proud. Also, one of his motivations is that one of his teammates was caught and put in to custody for armed shoplifting and robbery. Drew wants to play for him, as if he played well enough, his friend, Tony would be freed.<br />Drew grew so much as a character during hard times in Myers’ novel. Right off the bat, Tony’s incarceration changed how Drew thought about playing basketball. Also, his relationships shifted over the season, especially with one of the new white kids. Tomas comes from Prague, Czechoslovakia. He played there, but he was flooded, and his father got a job in New York.He tried to bring him into the basketball “family” at Baldwin , and that is also a way Drew changed as a main character. He also grew by playing, as any other athlete would: through technique and friendships.<br />Any basketball player out there will love Myers’ novel, and I could easily read it again and love it every time. My rating: one hundred and ten out of one hundred.<br />Griffin<br />Harper Teen, 218 Pages
