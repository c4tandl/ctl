<p>When a fifteen-year-old
artist, Lina, is ripped from her home in 1941, all she can think about is her
father, who has been separated from her brother, mother, and her. While she
grieves for him, she is also terrified for her own life, as she makes her way
through Russian territory to slave away with limited food and rest at work camp
after work camp. She attempts to send her artwork to her father to let him know
she’s alive—in hopes he will receive it and understand it’s from his daughter.
As she and her family take on an incredibly harrowing journey, she learns the
most powerful values are strength, love, and hope.</p>

<p>I fell in love with the
characters in this book, especially the main character of Lina. She is
developed flawlessly as a strong young lady who can fend for herself, even in
the tough environment that holds her captive. She and her brother are unlike
any other brother-sister pair I’d ever heard of or seen. Their cooperation and
support for each other is heartwarming and will keep readers invested throughout
the ups and downs of the conflict. </p>

<p>The plot was extremely
suspenseful and fast-paced. The storyline is interesting because Lina and her
family are constantly being moved from camp to camp, and the audience will want
to follow them on their journey. I loved how Sepetys ended each chapter on a
suspenseful note; this was another aspect that added to the fast pace.</p>

<p>Although <em>Between Shades
of Gray</em> is a work of fiction, it is well researched, and Sepetys includes many
details about World War Two. She describes specific places in Russia and Poland,
where the work camps were, and exactly the cities they traveled through.
 This made the book plausible and more enjoyable to read, knowing that it
could have happened in real life.   </p>

<p>Lina’s art was a wonderful
addition to the plot, because the reader is always curious about whether her
art will reach her father, and if it did, how that would affect her story.
It also helped develop Lina as a character, because
the artwork gave her a passion that added to her personality. </p>

<p>Sepetys has also published
two other historical novels that are just as compelling as this one: <em>Salt to
the Sea </em>and <em>Out of the Easy. </em>I have only read <em>Salt to the Sea, </em>but
it easily became my favorite book of the year. <em>Between Shades of Gray</em> is a must-read, and I guarantee that your
perspective on war and violence will be forever changed.</p>
