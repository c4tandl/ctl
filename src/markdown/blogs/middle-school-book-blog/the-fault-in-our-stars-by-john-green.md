From the first chapter of this book I couldn’t put it down.  This is one of those books where once you start reading, you can’t stop.  Before you know it, you’ve been reading for three hours.  I rated this book an obvious ten.  Green is spectacular at developing his characters and plot.  For example, when Hazel is speaking to Augustus for the second time goofing around with him, they are talking to each other so easily that their personalities shine through.  As I was reading the story it felt like I was in the book with them.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Fault in Our Stars</span> is a lengthy book but can be finished easily in two nights once the fascinating plot sucks you in.  This book is full of amazing, unforgettable stories (from Hazel’s friend smashing trophies to visiting Anne Frank’s house) that make you want to read on.

The genre of this book is realistic teen issue with an unexpected twist of action-adventure that surprises you in the middle of the book.

I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of twelve.  I mostly read action-adventure and thrillers, but anyone that reads this captivating teen issue novel will fall in love with it just like I did.  There are no over-the-top or unrealistic moments.  Green has perfectly pieced this novel together in an inspiring way that makes you think about all you take for granted.
