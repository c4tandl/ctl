<p>The year is 1817, and seventeen year
old dressmaker Celine Rousseau is fleeing from Paris. This is how she finds
herself in the french Quarter of New Orleans, under the care (and watchful eye)
of the Ursuline convent. Celine plans to restart her life in the lively
carnival city, but soon, her wit and curiosity lead Celine to rebel against
society's constrictions, and right into the Court De Lions. This dangerous,
underground elite society holds more power over the city than anyone would ever
imagine— and there’s more to it than meets the eye. With grotesque killings and
a mysterious murder haunting the city, Celine dives into this world brimming
with magic, decit, feuds, and Sébastien—the alluring, quick-witted gentleman
who leads it all. Celine is determined to find the killer, unearth this city’s
secrets, and avoid falling in love— all while carving out a new future for
herself.</p>

<p>In this book, Renée Ahdeih proves how
versatile she is in her writing—from retellings, to feudal Japan, and now 18th
century New Orleans. In her latest book, Ahdeih immerses her characters in a
vibrant and alluring recreation of the French Quarter. Even readers without
prior knowledge about the setting will still feel like they know the bustling
streets and dark alleys personally, as they read her work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ahdeih uses multiple perspectives—
some of them named, and a few mysterious. Although the majority was through
Celine’s perspective, Ahdeih also included chapters from the past, and many
from the killer. As a reader, it was eerie to watch the killer plotting, and
picking their next target— than for Celine to discover them dead the next day.
By using the multiple perspectives, she was also able to maintain many story
lines at once, like clues that the reader had to piece together. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By giving the killer a voice, Ahdeih
created a deeper character, instead of just another classic antagonist. It made
me question whether the Court of Lions and Celine were truly innocent, or if
maybe the killer had justification. Ahdeih doesn't just give the reader a plot
to watch from afar, but launches them into the story, and forces readers to
question all of the characters, while attempting to solve the mystery. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although I have never looked for
mysteries when choosing books, This read has convinced me to do otherwise. I
loved piecing together the clues with Celine. Ahdeih was able to create a
remarkable mystery, without sacrificing the character development, or the
relationships in the book. Ahdeih misleads both Celine and the reader, with
obscure leads and hidden signs that will stun in the end. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of french dialogue by many of
the characters added to their personalities, and made the setting come to life.
Much of it, a reader could guess what they were saying, and some dialogue would
have explanations as Celine thought about what was being said in her mind.
However— there were a few times when it was difficult to understand, and felt
like I was missing something intriguing or comedic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The separate plots transverse multiple
decades. Ahdieh is unique in the way she keeps her plots entirely separate,
until the final chapters. This adds to the suspense, and helps build depth in
characters—you can see different aspects of their personality. For example,
watching the killer when they are younger and the protagonist of their own
story, and present time— when they have changed dramatically, and are now the
antagonist. The stories twisted together in the final chapters creating an
action-packed, revelation-full, and stunning finale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For readers looking for romance, this
book will certainly provide. Celine and Sebastian’s relationship evolves
beautifully throughout the story, yet never overpowers the plot. Celine is not
helpless nor obsessive, which is a refreshing take on the classic
enemies-yet-love-interest scenario Ahdieh implements. Because Celine is such a
strong protagonist, and Sebastian goes so much deeper as a character than just
their relationship, their romance is never stereotypical or predictable.
Instead, it forms a realistic window into society during the 18th century. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the aspect that pushes this
book one more step ahead is Ahdeih’s writing. She creates paragraphs like a
poet, and the emotion behind every phrase is evident. Readers will linger on
sentences packed with stunning diction, and metaphors that are carefully
crafted. Ahdeih writes as if her words are not only prose, but free-verse
poetry— and the result is magic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“The
creature inside Celine writhed beneath her skin, stirring to life. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No.
Celine Rousseau was not a weathervane. She would not be moved by the Ghost’s
presence as everyone else was.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ahdeih has created yet another
masterpiece, which will enthrall readers from the first page, all the way to
the thrilling last chapters. Readers who enjoy dystopia, romance, or simply a
strong female protagonist will love this book— and long to to live in the world
of Celine Rousseau.</p>
