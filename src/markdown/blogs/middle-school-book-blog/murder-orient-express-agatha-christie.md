 In the brutal winter of 1934, famous detective Hercule Poirot catches the Orient Express only to find that a murder occurs the first night he’s on board. When the train is halted by a snow drift, everyone wakes up to find Samuel Ratchett dead in his compartment. Poriot takes the matter in his own hands and determines to find the murderer by interviewing all the passengers who were in that car. When matters get complicated, Poroit has to rely on his friendships to solve this mysterious crime.<br />I loved how Christie used third-person narrative, so she was able to obscure the characters’ thoughts. When I noticed she used that perspective I didn’t understand why she would choose it. But as I neared the end, I realized that, otherwise, the conclusion would be revealed about half way through the book.<br />Christie uses older language, not on purpose, but just because that is how people spoke when she wrote the book. Even though the diction was a bit complicated, I had no problem being able to understand it. It is set in Europe, and French is the main language on the train, so there are a few French references.<br />The character Hercule Poirot is a clever man with a lot of interesting ideas that he keeps to himself. He is a classic detective, who loves a good mystery. Christie doesn’t make you close to the supporting characters so that if one of them is the murderer, you won’t be heartbroken. It also makes the plot a lot harder to predict. The end was confusing; I read it through once and didn’t immediately understand. So I read the end again and understood it a lot better. The conclusion was creative, which made it impossible to guess what happened. The setting beyond the train, is not revealed outside, except that you know there is a snow drift preventing the train from going anywhere. I thought this was effective because you focused more on the mystery than on what had happened outside of the train.<br />I rated this book a ten because it is extremely rare to find a captivating mystery that is not scary. I also enjoyed how about eighty percent of the book is told through interviews with the passengers. If you enjoyed this breathtaking book, the movie came out, and it is just as thrilling. <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> never lacked an exciting moment and made me think on my feet throughout the book. What would you do if you had to risk your life to solve a murder?<br />Kate<br />Harper Collins, 315 pages<br /> <br />
