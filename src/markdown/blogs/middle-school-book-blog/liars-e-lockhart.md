Each summer they return to their summer homes on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts. The liars, a group of three teenage cousins, make every summer unforgettable. But why does Cadence not remember what happened during summer fifteen?<br />The liars referred to in the title are a group of teenage cousins: Cadence, Mirren, and Johnny. Each summer they are joined by Gat, an old family friend. Before Gat started coming to Beechwood Island during summer eight, the cousins were never the troublemaking team they ended up becoming.<br />After reading the first page of the book, I was already sucked into the mysterious plot and lives of the characters. If you decide to start reading this book, you won’t be able to put it down. I rated this novel a perfect ten. Lockhart makes each chapter seem like the reader is getting closer to finding out what happened that summer, which makes her audience want to read on. And on. And on. For hours.<br />This book is told from Cadence’s perspective, as if she were narrarating her story after she had remembered her accident. <em>We Were Liars</em> goes back and forth between present tense and stories from summer fifteen. I would recommend this book to any reader. I usually read contemporary realistic fiction, but after reading this, I added drama/mystery to my list of favorite genres.<br />The ending of this book will cause your jaw to drop, no matter who you are. It is so unexpected that it made me and my peers want to reread the second half. After finding out what happens in summer fifteen, the plot comes together and starts to make more sense. Cadence knows that what happened was terrible, and she asks family members who witnessed the accident to help fill in the details. She, along with the readers, wants answers.<br />Katie<br />Delacorte Press, 227 pages<br />
