<p>Zélie
Adebola remembers when there was magic in the air, in the sea, and in the soil.
Zélie Adebola remembers her mother’s magic protecting her from evil forces and
helping her in any way. Zélie Adebola remembers when magic disappeared. Zélie
Adebola remembers her mother's slaughter. She will never forget, and now she
can do something about it, with a newly found scroll of power that restores
only a small portion of magic, she can fight King Saran and his evil ways. With
the help of her brother, the king's daughter, and a bunch of others along the
way, she will fight without rest to restore magic fully: to the Maji, to her
fellow Diviners, and to the world.</p>

<p>Adeyemi
created an amazing plot in this book and used effective strategies and
structure to give the reader a full experience. One of these was multiple
perspectives–every chapter the point of view changes and is always in first
person, so it’s like the reader is in each character's head and knows his or
her thoughts. Because of the multiple perspectives, the reader is not limited
to one person, but gets to know all the important characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And
who are those characters? They are Zélie Adebola, Amari, and Inan. Zélie, as
explained before, was a girl destined to have magic, specifically over death.
Then it all disappeared and her mother was slaughtered. After she gets the
scroll to save magic forever, a reader would think that she would be on board
with bringing magic back a hundred percent, but after meeting a group of
Diviner rebels, she actually has second thoughts: Is it safe to bring magic
back? Would it really make everything better?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One
of the most important characters is Amari, King Saran's daughter. She is the
one who brings the scroll to Zélie and needs her help to escape. Amari is one
of those characters that looks soft and vulnerable on the outside, but on the
inside, she has the skills of a ninja master. She’s brave, determined, and
wants to help anyone in need–in this case Zélie and the Diviners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then
there’s Inan. He may not be the most important or destined character, but he’s
a red devil with white angel wings and a halo. He's obviously a devil, although
he also has good qualities, and knows what’s right and wrong, but he’s King
Saran’s son, so that adds conflict to the plot.</p>

<p>This
title may seem like a good, classic, “Bring magic back” fantasy. But that’s not
simply the case with this book; it has much deeper meanings. For one, there’s a
strong racism metaphor, but instead of black skin, it’s white hair, because
anyone with white hair has magic, or <em>had </em>magic. These white haired
people are the Diviners, and they are discriminated against. Seeing the impact
of this discrimination definitely changed my view of this fantasy book’s world
and the real world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Overall, this is one of the best novels I’ve
ever read, with the most intriguing characters, plot, and themes. I recommend
this book to anyone who loves magic, meaning, and thrill. Adeyemi’s novel is
100% a ten out of ten title. I hope any reader will enjoy!</p>
