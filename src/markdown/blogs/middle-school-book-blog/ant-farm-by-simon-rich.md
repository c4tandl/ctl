<p><em>Ant Farm</em> features short humorous vignettes that poke fun at everyday situations and objects, such as the label of a candy bar, which “may or may not contain peanuts.” Have you ever wondered what ants trapped in an ordinary ant farm feel? Have you ever thought about getting a job at the Crayola company? All of these hypotheticals and more will be answered in Simon Rich’s book, <em>Ant Farm.</em> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of these vignettes are based on the author’s perspective as a child: for instance, “a day at UNICEF headquarters as i imagined it in third grade” (every title is written in lowercase) is the author as a third grader, dreaming up a picture of the “evil king of Halloween, UNICEF,” who tricks kids into gathering money for him. Oftentimes there isn’t a specific perspective to connect with, as many of the vignettes are written as screenplay scripts, like “i still remember the day i got my first calculator.”</p>

<p><em>ME: You...you knew about this machine all along, didn’t you? This whole time, while we were going through this...this charade with the pencils and the line of paper and the stupid multiplication tables! I’m sorry for shouting...it’s just...I’m a little blown away.</em></p>

<p>Others are written simply as two characters talking, like in “ant farm.” </p>

<p><em>—All right, men, listen up. As you know, we’ve built seven tunnels and we still haven’t found a way through the glass. I can tell you’re discouraged and I can’t blame you. Tunnel 7 was our most ambitious project to date and you all risked your lives to make it happen. But rest assured, we’ll be out of this hellish wasteland soon enough. I have a plan.</em></p>

<p><em>—What is it? What’s the plan?</em></p>

<p><em>—An eighth tunnel. Through the sand.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>—I don’t know, sir...we’ve been digging tunnels ever since we got here. We always end up hitting glass. We lost ten men on the last tunnel: Brian, Jack, Lawrence—</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>—I know their names.</em></p>

<p>However, there are recurring characters throughout the book: Seymour, the sweet, clueless kid who just attracts unfortunate attention; the teacher, who is blunt and bored with life; and God, ruler of them all, who occasionally abuses his power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My experience with this book was a great one, and I devoured it quickly, often re-reading chapters because they were so relatable. The author finds so many everyday situations to make fun of and add new life to. There were chapters that I found hilarious because the content Rich was writing about was in my life as well, and even I didn’t realize it was until I read his take on it! The chapters are the perfect length: not too short to leave out details, but not too long, so the author leaves space for the reader to dream up other scenarios. </p>

<p>I would rate this book a ten out of ten and would recommend it to teens or tweens with an older sense of humor, because I found the situations and humor young adult, although this book is relatable for all ages. The author has written several other books as well, including <em>Free Range Chickens</em> and <em>Hits and Misses,</em> both of which I haven’t personally read but am excited for. Readers will be fully engaged and fascinated by <em>Ant Farm</em> and will come away with a sense of satisfaction.</p>
