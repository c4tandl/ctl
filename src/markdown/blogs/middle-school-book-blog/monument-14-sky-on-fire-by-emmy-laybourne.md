You forget to say goodbye to your mom, you go out to get on your bus, and your little brother is right behind you to catch his bus, too. When you are on your bus and you hear a noise—a<i> clang, clang, clang.</i> You see hail coming down. It gets faster and faster, bigger and bigger, and then the bus is sliding. Your bus crashes into a big box store. You finally see your brother’s bus backing up to save you—well, you hope.<br />That is the scene that begins <i>Monument 14 </i>and continues in <i>Monument 14: Sky on Fire </i>by Emmy Laybourne. It is the sequel in what is planned as a trilogy. Both books are about the main character, Dean, his brother, Alex, and their friends as they try to survive. One of the problems is that there is a bad cloud of poison. If you breathe it in, you can get terrible symptoms depending on your type of blood. Type A gets very bad blisters, B gets reproductive difficulties, AB becomes paranoid, and O gets rabid and kills all who come near.<br />I like how Emmy Layboune makes the people who come into the book and all the different problems so real. That is why I rated it a 9.5 out of 10. I didn’t like that the book focused so much on boy-girl relationships. But it is a good book, and I think everyone who likes action and adventure, dystopia, and teen issues would enjoy this exciting sequel.<br />Carissa<br />Felwel and Friends New York, 215 pages
