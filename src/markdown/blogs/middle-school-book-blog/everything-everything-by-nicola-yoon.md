<p>Madeline is a seventeen-year-old girl who has a rare disease that makes her allergic to the world. Her only interactions with people are with her caring nurse, Carla, and her controlling mother. But when a boy moves in next door, Madeline is curious and eager to meet him. Will Madeline ever get a chance to meet the stranger next door? Will this change in her life turn into an experience she could never imagine? Will she discover something about herself that will change everything? These are the questions asked and the answers revealed in Everything Everything by Nicola Yoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way Yoon structured the story was very
interesting. The chapters were titled differently every time, and the chapters ranged
anywhere from one sentence to six pages long. Some of the pages had little
pencil sketches of health charts or text messages. This added a fun touch to
the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with all its plot twists, the book is
contemporary realistic fiction, meaning everything in it could actually happen
in real life. This meant that the plot was more intense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yoon used a lot of sensory diction to make the
story come alive, which gets the reader thinking: if you were in this position,
what decision would you make? How would the consequences that follow affect
your life?</p>

<p>Yoon told an amazing story of love, family,
and disagreement. I would give this book a ten out of ten because
Yoon did a great job crafting the novel. She made it so I didn’t want to put
the book down. The pace was perfect so I never got bored. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would recommend
this book to anyone who loves a fast, fun, loving story.</p>
