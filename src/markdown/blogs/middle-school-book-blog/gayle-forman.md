 When Cody’s best friend Megan unexpectedly kills herself while at college, Cody departs on a wild adventure to uncover why Meg would take such a drastic step. On the way, Cody meets many of Meg’s friends, including Ben McCallister, who may have been Meg’s boyfriend. Cody becomes suspicious of Ben while accidentally falling for him. They embark on several road trips and meet weird people who might have convinced Meg to kill herself.<br />The big idea of this book is losing someone very special to you and the pain going through that experience. There is a lot of dialogue in this read, including disagreements, happy talks, and sad moments all of which are entertaining to read.<br />The main character, Cody, is at college in her hometown when she gets an email saying that Meg is sorry but she had to do this. Nonetheless Cody loves her best friend and is heartbroken when the event occurs. She gets through it well but is still sad. The characters are easy to relate with if you have lost someone special. Readers will go through the death of Meg with all the characters and understand their thoughts about everything that occurs.<br />I rated this book a nine out of ten. Forman wrote the book well with very strong visuals so that the reader can see a movie in his or her head while reading.<br />With her intriguing theme and well-pieced-together characters that will make you want to read on, this book is easily read in two to three nights.<br />The genre of this novel is contemporary realistic fiction. If you loved Forman’s <em>If I Stay</em> and <em>Where She Went</em> you will be a fan of this book. I would recommend this book to readers thirteen and up. I think females would enjoy this read much more than males. I wouldn’t be surprised if a movie of the book were filmed. Be sure to read the book first!<br />Jolie<br />VIKING, 288 pages
