 When Kate’s father gets killed for a journal that contains a map to a gold mine, she knows it’s up to her to get vengeance for her father and get back the journal. Kate dresses up like a boy and sets off to find the Western gang called the Rose Riders who stole the journal, but so far all she finds is the desert and two cowboys, Jesse and Will, and an Apache Indian. Will Kate find her journal without being caught, or anyone realizing she’s a girl?<br />This book is an action-packed Western novel, with surprises and turns that will make readers sad, glad, and mad. The book starts off with Kate at home with her dad and has action right from the beginning, which makes the book very fast-paced and exciting. The novel also is set in back the Wild West, which sets it apart: I haven’t come across many young adult books set around that time period. The book includes comedy, action, and romance, which is a perfect combination here.The author, Erin Bowman, makes the plot exciting and packed full of adventure, and also balances the book out perfectly so readers can understand what’s happening.<br />The protagonist, Kate, is an emotional character: she has so many different feelings in the book it’s hard to keep track of them all. She’s so determined in get revenge on the Rose Riders that you don't even think about how soft inside she can actually be. Jesse and Will are two characters that I didn’t think were important at first, but then realized how key they really were. I just thought they were going to leave the main character at the nearest town, but I was wrong.<br />Erin Bowman makes every chapter engaging and ends each so you want to read more. She makes all the characters interesting. I really enjoyed this book. I would rate it a ten and recommend it to any young adult reader who likes action, adventure with horses, and long risky survival journeys. I hope anyone who reads this book will love it as much as I did.<br />Lexi
