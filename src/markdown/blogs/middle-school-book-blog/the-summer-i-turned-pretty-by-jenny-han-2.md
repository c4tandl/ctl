Belly has been chasing Conrad for as long as she can remember. Will this be the summer that changes everything? Despite the distractions from a new boy, Cam, and Jeremiah, Belly’s heart belongs to Conrad.

I rated <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> a ten. Every chapter introduced a new, surprising concept that hooked me, and I could not put down the book for even a second. Han’s book had a very intense friendships and romance, but in general it is a very easy read.

“Moments, when lost, can’t be found again. They’re just gone,” Belly says in this book. I loved this quote so much because it reminds me of summer in Cape Cod and how I yearn to be back there with all my friends and just have fun. Han captures the magic of summer in her writing.

The theme of this book if friendship and romance because of all the amazing times Belly has with Susannah, her mother, Jeremiah and Conrad.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun, easy read and a great story of friendships and lots of relationships. There are also two other books in the series: <em>It's Not Summer Without You </em>and<em> We'll Always Have Summer.</em> As you read more you get into the style of Han’s writing. <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> is a must read for anyone and everyone.
