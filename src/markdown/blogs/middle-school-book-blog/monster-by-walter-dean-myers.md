The whole story is really sensory, and the dialogue is really realistic.

<em>Monster</em> is a pretty fast read. The 281 pages seem a lot fewer because once a reader gets into it, he or she doesn’t want to stop.   You’ll want to to find out what happens to Steve in the end.

One theme of the book is that all teenagers will lose their innocence.  Another is about the violence and crime in America, how it’s bad for our society, and how it needs to be stopped.

I don’t think I can compare Myers to any other writer because he is  unique.  Most of his books are set in Harlem, or have references to Harlem, because that’s where he grew up, so there’s a truer, more realistic sense about everything he writes.  And his sports novels about basketball are way more than just stories about how a team makes it to the championship;  he creates a life for his characters on and off the court.  Other books by Myers that I’ve also loved are <em>Shooter</em>, <em>Fallen Angels</em>, <em>Autobiography of My Dead Brother</em>, <em>Game</em>, <em>Slam</em>, <em>Hoops</em>, and its sequel <em>The Outside Shot</em>.

Moving back to<em> Monster</em>, the conclusion is very satisfying, and I think all readers will agree with what happens to Steve.   Overall I rated this book a 10 out of 10.   It was fascinating and original.   If you haven’t checked it out yet, I think you should definitely try it. You’ll get hooked on Walter Dean Myers’ writing, and that’s a good thing.
