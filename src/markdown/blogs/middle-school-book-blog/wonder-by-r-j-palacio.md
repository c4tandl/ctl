August Pullman is an eleven-year-old boy with nothing “normal” about his life. He has been home-schooled up until the first day of fifth grade. Auggie has a rare, genetic facial deformity that challenges his social experience. His first day, of school is an interesting one. He meets many people that are nice, but some others who aren’t-they stop and stare at him, but he makes it out alive. Auggie makes friends with Jack Will, Charlotte, and Summer, but makes enemies with Julian. Julian is a boy in his class who puts notes in his locker, tries to trip him, and goes out of his way to be mean. Auggie also has a amazing language arts teacher named, Mr. Brown. from whom he learns some very important lessons.<br />I love the way the R.J Palacio wrote this <em>wonder-</em>ful novel. When I read it, I couldn’t put the book down. I think that Palacio’s reason for writing it was that she wanted to teach children about growing up with a deformity and about kindness and friendship. It definitely taught me about kindness and made me want to be a better friend, too. Palacio uses different perspectives so a reader can relate to other characters besides Auggie. However, as a reader I enjoyed the “Auggie” chapters most because I felt like I already knew the other characters and wanted to learn more about Auggie.<br />Palacio wrote the books, <em>Pluto, Shingaling, 33 Minutes, </em>and <em>That Was the River. The Fault in our Stars </em>by John Green strikes me as a version of <em>Wonder, </em>with older characters. I think that Palacio and Green tried to put the same message across. After you read <em>Wonder </em>you should definitely read <em>The Fault in our Stars.</em> <em>Wonder</em> is an amazing book that both girls, and boys would love. It’s a book that I read over the summer of sixth grade, but I believe that anyone over ten could, and should, read this book.<br />Ella<br />Alfred A. Knopf, 316 pages.
