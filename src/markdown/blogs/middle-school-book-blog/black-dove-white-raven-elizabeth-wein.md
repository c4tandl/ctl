 Black Dove and White Raven are the stage names of Delia, and Rhoda a team of female stunt-pilots. Traveling with them as they perform are their two young children, Emilia and Teo. During one of their shows, a bird strike crashes their plane and immediately kills Teo’s mother. Emilia’s mother, Rhoda, survives and adopts Teo. But in this novel’s particular time, 1930’s America, it is often considered suspicious to see a white woman raising a black adopted son alongside her own white daughter. Following Delia’s lifelong dream, Rhoda moves to Ethiopia so she can raise Teo where he won’t be discriminated against for the color of his skin. But soon after they arrive, war with the Italians threatens to push them out forever.<br />This historical fiction book by Elizabeth Wein (author of <em>Rose Under Fire</em> and<em> Code Name Verity</em>) is told in the first person through a letter to the emperor from the present (March 4, 1936), and then a collection of stories from the past attached. Wein gives the reader an overall idea of all the different characters and incorporates the points of view of both Teo and Emilia using flight log entries. These logs give the reader a glimpse of the characters’ thoughts, almost like a diary, revealing untold emotions. Throughout the book , short stories that Emilia and Teo write foreshadow or explain complicated events in a simpler situation. Wein portrays the characters in a way that makes the story come to life.<br />Although the beginning of the book is slow to develop, the result is an action-packed conclusion. Wein’s detailed plot will make the reader laugh and cry alongside the characters. This heartfelt historical fiction novel would be enjoyed by anyone who likes a heroic adventure. I definitely rate this book a ten out of ten for its realistic and unforgettable story.<br />Arden<br />Hyperion, 345 pages
