<b><i/></b><b> </b>Celaena Sardothien is a fearless assassin in the city of Adarlan and is one year into her life sentence in the salt mines of Endovier. But after a long day in the dark endless  mines she is greeted by six guards and a strange man in black.They bring her to the prince (the king’s son) to be looked over before she is invited to the glass castle to compete in the king’s competition for the title of king’s champion—basically his hitman. One of the king’s many different challenges reveals how the lack of training in the salt mines affected Celaena, who she would normally be at the top of the group. Because of her lack of strength she goes to the king as a different person with a different name so she won’t look bad.<br />Maas effectively balances out the amount of action and adventure with the drama and romance so readers never get bored with the plot. Maas did an excellent job developing all the characters. For example, when she was developing Celaena Sardothien she made her a brutal, emotionless assassin with a soft side for the people closest to her, like her friends and masters at the assassin’s guild. I think that the author could have added more detail about Celaena’s past, like how long was she an assassin before she got captured and sent to Endovire, but that is why audiences should also read The Assassin’s Blade, which is the prequel to Throne of Glass.<br />I think that anyone would love this book whether they like fantasy, action- adventure, or drama because this novel has all of those elements rolled into one amazing, must-read story. Celaena grows from being some heartless assassin who got locked in the mines after years of killing for money, to a nicer more trustworthy character who will surprise readers throughout the entire book— and the rest of the series if they choose to read it. A good example this transformation from the start of the book is seeing how her relationship grows with the captain of the royal guard and the prince of Auterland.<br />Zephaniah<br />Bloomsbury Publishing, Inc., 404 pages
