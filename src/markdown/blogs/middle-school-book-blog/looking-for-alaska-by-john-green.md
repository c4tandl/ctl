<p>Miles Halter memorizes last words. The Colonel
just memorizes. So when they end up as Junior year roommates at Culver Creek
High School were Miles, or Pudge is new and The Colonel is a three year vet.
With The Colonel and soon Pudge’s best friend Alaska Young, is introduced
Miles, the year is on course for greatness. Alaska, The Colonel, and Pudge are
all ‘Boarders’ and are sworn enemies of the ‘Weekday Warriors’. </p>

<p><em>I sat down next to him, and
he looked over at me and suddenly said, “Listen. I’m not going to be your
entrée to Culver Creek social life.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Uh, okay,” I said, but I
could hear the words catch in my throat. I’d just carried this guy’s couch
beneath a white-hot sun and now he didn’t like me?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Basically you’ve got two
groups here,” he explained, speaking with increasing urgency. “You’ve got
regular boarders, like me, then you’ve got the weekday Warriors; they board
here, but they’re all rich kids who live in Birmingham and go home to their
parents’ air-conditioned mansions every weekend. Those are the cool kids. I
don’t like them, and they don’t like me.</em><em>”</em><em/></p>

<p>As this passage illustrates, John Green’s
writing style and his understanding of teen social interactions is unsurpassed.
The theme of this novel is how nothing lasts forever, save suffering due to
that being the theme of a book mentioned throughout the novel that had some
remarkable parallels with <em>Alaska</em>. </p>

<p>John Green’s debut is told in first person in
the past tense with every chapter title counting down the days until an event
happens. This choice makes this very fast paced, due to the intrigue of what
the event is. This novel has won the Michael L. Printz Award and has been
adapted into a show, and a movie is in the works.</p>

<p>I rated this contemporary realistic fiction a
ten out of ten, but it is for seventh grade and up due to reference to drugs,
some profanity and suggestive content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Looking for Alaska </em>is an example of the perfect contemporary realistic fiction with
all its full characters like The Eagle, dean and doom of students who can smell
a cigarette from a mile away, and rich dialogue as shown above.</p>
