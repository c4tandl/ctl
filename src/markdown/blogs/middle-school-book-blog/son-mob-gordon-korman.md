 When Vince discovers that his dad’s vending machine business doesn't involve vending machines but instead involves scamming and cheating people out of their money, he goes to great lengths to distance himself from his dad’s mob and all the dirty money that comes with it. But when he starts dating Kendra Blighty, whose dad turns out to be the FBI agent who's been trying to put Vince's father in jail, the plot starts to take a turn. This is the story of the book <em>Son of the Mob </em>by Gordon Korman.<br />I like the way the Korman crafted the book as to make it funny but serious at the same time. He includes jokes but manages to keep the plot rolling without laughing you out of the reading zone. The narrative voice is first person from the perspective of Vince, the main character, and that's effective because readers get a window into Vince’s views, which are a very important part of the book.<br />Vince evolved a lot during the book from being unsure of his ideas and is unaware of where he wants to go with his life to having strong opinions and knowing for sure that he doesn't want anything to do with his life.<br />If you like books by Gordon Korman <em>Son of the Mob</em> will not disappoint it is packed with the same humor and same action you would find in other books by him such as <em>Masterminds</em>. It is easy to follow and you will never find yourself looking for action.<br />This book is a good example for when someone feels something so strongly they would betray their own dad to not have to do something. For example Vince believes that what his dad’s doing is wrong so he goes against his dad to do what he thinks is right by not taking any part in his dad's business.<br />If you like humor and weird matches this is the book for you. I rated this book a 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone ages eleven and up.<br />Marlowe<br />Disney-Hyperion, 240 pages
