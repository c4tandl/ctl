<p><em>Jennifer
Harris and Cameron Quick were tight. Being the outcasts in elementary school
meant they had to stick together through the toughest times. As best friends,
they could never be split apart. Suddenly, without notice, Cameron disappeared
and was never seen again, leaving Jennifer all alone in a world full of
choices. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Now, in
her last years of high school, Jennifer is known as Jenna, the popular one,
with new friends and a boyfriend. But she doesn’t feel like her true self
anymore. How could she push the memories of Cameron away when he was the only
one who saw her for who she really was? And what would happen if he
reappeared? </em></p>

<p>I loved
how Zarr could write about a touching relationship between a girl and a boy
without making it romantic. She created such a nice bond between the both of
them, starting from when they were little and giving readers vivid sensory
images of how they grew up together. Throughout the book as  Jenna gets
older, Zarr connects all the puzzle pieces along the way to reveal how Cameron
disappeared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s
depth and emotion in this book, especially in how Jenna and Cameron get to
relive their childhood memories together and feel nostalgic for the old times
once they are finally reunited. They are a strong duo, and it is nice to watch
them grow as people when they are together. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I
enjoyed the pace of this book because it wasn’t slow, and it wasn’t fast
either. I think Zarr wanted her audience to savor the moments in time and
intrigue us more and more every chapter.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found
it interesting how Zarr made the book two different genres: teen fiction, which
gave readers the relatable moments of being a teenager throughout the whole
story, but it was also a mystery because each step she incorporates flashbacks
that Jenna keeps having from when she and Cameron were young. Little by little,
readers figure out why Cameron disappeared, which I thought was cool because it
felt like I was solving my own mystery. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall
this book was touching, and the theme was relatable for me. It was nice that it
was in first person so readers could be in Jenna’s perspective and read about
her thoughts and feelings as time goes on. If you’re the type of reader looking
for a book that is a heartwarming story about two best friends split apart, I
think this is the right book for you. </p>
