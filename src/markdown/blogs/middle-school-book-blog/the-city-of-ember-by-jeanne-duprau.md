<p>Lina Mayfleet and Doon
Harrow live in the city of Ember, a place eternally shrouded in darkness,
except for the electric light bulbs spread across the town. However, food is
running out, and the lights have been flickering constantly. When city jobs are
assigned, Lina’s worst fear comes true: she’s assigned to the most menial
task—Pipeworks laborer. However, by circumstance, Doon happens to have her
dream job: messenger. He offers to trade, in order to inspect the generator—the
cause of the blackouts plaguing the city— and she is overjoyed. But then she
discovers scraps of parchment hidden in a closet, which could shine a light on
everything hidden in the darkness of Ember. They could even lead to a path out
of the city. This is the dystopian story of <em>The City of Ember </em>by Jeanne DuPrau—and
the beginning of a great series.</p>

<p>But this isn’t just a book
about a few pieces of ripped parchment and a city in darkness. It’s a book
about how limited conditions for the many can elevate the few, and therefore an
allegory for corruption and authoritarianism. Explaining these crucial events
in detail would spoil the plot of the book, but it’s enought to say that
corruption is contained within the darkness of Ember. As Ember is essentially a
poverty-ridden police state, similar to today’s North Korea, when this
corruption is discovered, the full extent of its leaders’  power is
revealed. This unfolds throughout the entire book, beginning with the event
mentioned above, and continuing into the sequel, <em>The People of Sparks, </em>where
DuPrau also handles such delicate and controversial issues as xenophobia.
DuPrau weaves these in expertly, beginning with a detour from the path out of
Ember, and incorpoating it throughout the rest of the book and its sequel. </p>

<p>I loved how the novel
showed exactly what it would be like to live in a world deprived of such basic
technology as a movable light. It was interesting to ponder what our world
would look like without the technology we have developed, and even as a
possible, hopefully distant, future way of life. It challenges the popular
notion of futuristic ways of life as dominated by technology by presenting a
vision of life without it. </p>

<p>The third person narrative
voice usually makes readers feel much more distant from the characters, but
DuPrau utilized it so expertly that it makes the audience feel just as close to
the characters as they would if the novel was written in first person, and it
spreads out the focus between the two main characters evenly. For example, when
Sadge Merrall returns from the Unknown Regions ranting and raving, readers will
almost feel Lina’s anxiety and fear, even through third person narration. For
another, when Lina and Doon are being pursued by the police, third person is
perfect, as it doesn’t have to use just one perspective, and the reader would
be much less confused. </p>

<p>DuPrau kept the pace
speedy, as this is an adventure novel at its core, but she also added some
truly powerful and insightful moments. I enjoyed this; it never felt slow
or drawn-out, but wasn’t shallow or without theme. The strong plot makes for a
quick but insightful reading experience. I flew through this, never lacking for
theme or pace. </p>

<p>I rated this book a ten out
of ten, as did many of my peers. This is for all the features that I have
already mentioned, as well as so many more that I could not possibly fit into
this short review. As I have mentioned, there is a sequel, <em>The People of
Sparks</em>, and it is exactly as enjoyable as its precursor. I would recommend
this to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced dystopian adventure with elements of
mystery and can still appreciate a captivating and insightful theme. Everyone
who has tried <em>The City of Ember</em> has enjoyed it, so therefore everyone
should try it.</p>
