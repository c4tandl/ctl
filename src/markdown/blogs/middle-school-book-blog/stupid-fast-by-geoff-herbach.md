<p>Fifteen-year-old
Felton Reinstein has a lot going on. He lives with his mom and brother. His dad
committed suicide when he was five, and his mom is still recovering. Felton’s best
friend Gus left for the summer to live with his ill grandmother in Venezuela,
and Felton has to take over his paper route. In a physical fitness test at his
school he had a better running time than everyone else. This leads to the
football coach recruiting him to play on the schools football team with all the
people who have made fun of him for years. Suddenly, he has to learn to learn
to fit in on the team at the same time as dealing with everything going on at
home with his mom. This summer Felton has to learn a lot of new things he’s
never done before.</p>

<p>Geoff Herbach writes in the first person in <em>Stupid Fast,</em> with shorter chapters: each one telling a story about what is happening in Felton’s life. This is interesting because the reader sees what he does in every situation and how he learns each time. Herbach shows every part of Felton’s life, good and bad, and that makes it hard for the reader to predict what was coming next in the book because it is so up and down.</p>

<p>I liked how Herbach made the book fast paced because there were a lot of smaller problems throughout the book. These were not hard to follow because they all affect the main problem and how he deals with it.</p>

<p><em>Stupid Fast</em> is the first of a three book series by Herbach. The second book is called <em>Nothing Special,</em> which I have not yet read, and the third book is called <em>I’m with Stupid.</em> I have read <em>I’m with Stupid, </em>and I enjoyed it, but it does get a little repetitive throughout the book. It’s not like <em>Stupid Fast</em> because it’s a completely different plot with new characters and problems, though still focused on Felton. But it just seems like he does the same thing over and over again in each situation, and that’s why I liked <em>Stupid Fast</em> better out of the two that I’ve read—because of the character growth that Herbach includes.</p>

<p>I rated this book a ten out of ten and would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sports fiction with some realistic fiction mixed in. It is a fast paced book with some humor and is not like most other sports books because it has a completely different plot and engaging characters that all add something new to the problem.</p>
