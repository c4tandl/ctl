<p><em>“You remember your first love because they show
you, prove to you, that you can love and be loved, that nothing in this world
is deserved except for love, that love is both how you become a person and
why.” </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aza looks like just your average, high-school-attending,
homework-worrying, friendship-building, teenage girl, but on the inside, her
mind is at war: part of her wants to hide away from the world, its germs, and
everyone in it. The other part of her wants to have a boyfriend, hang out with
her friends, and have fun. Her OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) gets in the
way of everything she wants. As John Green takes the reader along in <em>Turtles
All The Way Down</em>, Aza and her best friend, Daisy, discover that there is a
missing millionaire, with a sweet reward for whoever finds him, and he’s the
father of Aza’s childhood crush: Davis. Aza and Daisy meet with Davis,
immediately the friendship between Aza and Davis blossoms, and Aza’s interest
is returned. The sweet touch of first love in this novel will warm the
audience’s hearts and have readers aww-ing at each moment. As Aza and her
friends discover more of Davis’s missing father, they realize something else
may have happened entirely.</p>

<p>Aza’s enthralling journey is written in the first person, so it
feels as though Aza is talking directly to the reader. This novel will speak
strongly to audiences who deal with or know people who deal with mental
disabilities. Green has OCD, and a reader will know that how he writes about
Aza’s thoughts is accurate. He mentions the stress she endures, and how it
feels like her thoughts are spiraling down, indefinitely tightening. But, along
with helping the audience understand those with mental disabilities better,
this book will also show anyone the struggles of popularity, friendship,
relationships, family, and what the definition of ‘normal’ is. Green writes
about the last issue with such clarity and sureness that it will change
readers’ perspectives on the idea of that topic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout the novel, Aza describes how she thinks she isn’t in
control of her life, and how someone is writing her story, which is ironic
because someone is. It’s an amazing way to put the reader into Aza’s
perspective, and therefore be more understanding of her conflicts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now more on Aza’s friends: Daisy—her name says it all. A flower,
wild and sweet. Daisy helps Aza bloom out of her spiral of worries and thoughts
and shows her ways to get around her OCD. The audience will find Daisy a
relatable supporting character and be reminded of how strong friendship can be.
Then there’s Davis: he’s kind and is always looking out for Aza and overcoming
the obstacles that he faces with her OCD. His father is a missing millionaire
with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head, and his mother has been dead
since he was a kid, so Davis is empathetic to anyone who has hardships in their
life. Davis is an adorable character that readers will become connected to, and
will cheer on throughout the title.</p>

<p>This novel is so robust and moving that any reader will feel the
power of Green’s thoughts and work when they read it. He successfully shows the
capacity of true friendship and first loves, while stirring in hints of
mystery, and readers will fasten themselves to each character and be pulled
along for the ride. Anyone would adore this engrossing novel. I rated this book
an obvious ten out of ten, and I’m sure any reader would, too. So what are you
waiting for? Go to your closest library or book shop, or even Amazon will do,
and get <em>Turtles All The Way Down</em>. I promise you won’t regret it, and
soon enough you will be carried off into the fascinating universe Green has
constructed.</p>
