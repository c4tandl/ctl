<p>“One kid. One crime. One chance to make things right.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><br /><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arthur Owens grasps a stone
cold brick in his hand and hurls it at a garbage picker’s head. Luckily for
Arthur, the wind has picked up, and the brick hits the man in the arm, knocking
him into the street. Ever since Arthur lost his dad things haven’t been right,
but the judge doesn’t care, he wants to send Arthur away forever.  But the
Junk Man offers an alternative: 120 hours of community service, working for
him. Arthur is given a wonky shopping cart and a list of the “Seven Most
Important Things”: glass bottles, foil, cardboard, pieces of wood, lightbulbs,
coffee cans, and mirrors. Arthur is curious about what the Junk Man will do
with this “trash” that could potentially change his life. </p>

<p>In<em> The Seventh Most
Important Thing</em>, Shelley Pearsall crafts a remarkable story of how one
person and one idea change a life forever. However, this book does have some
mysterious aspects to it—it is kept a secret as to what the Junk Man is doing
with the “trash” until Arthur starts working with him in his garage. As the reader,
it is fun to experiment with theories as to what might happen next. During the
novel, the reader may notice how Arthur’s character changes over time, through
his family that surrounds him as they are struggling and as he continues to
work for the Junk Man, instead of going to juvenile detention.</p>

<p><em>The Seventh Most Important
Thing </em>is written in third person and is contemporary
realistic fiction. As a reader of this book, the pace could sometimes get a
little slow, and it was harder to read, but I encourage others to keep pushing
through: it will pay off. </p>

<p>This book also has a
fascinating real-life connection. The Judge reveals the Junk Man’s real name in
the court session—James Hampton. James Hampton was an American folk artist from
Washington, D.C., who worked as a janitor, but secretly built a large
assemblage of religious art from scavenged materials, known as “The Throne of
the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly.” It’s currently on
display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. </p>

<p>Pearsall has also written
two other books—<em>Trouble Don’t Last </em>and <em>Jump Into The Sky. </em>Both
have been strongly reviewed on Publishers Weekly and Booklist, looking like
great reads. <em>Trouble Don’t Last </em>won the Scott O’Dell Award for
Historical Fiction in 2003. </p>

<p>I would rate this book a ten out of ten and recommend it to anyone who loves to see the power of one mistake turned into something unimaginable. </p>
