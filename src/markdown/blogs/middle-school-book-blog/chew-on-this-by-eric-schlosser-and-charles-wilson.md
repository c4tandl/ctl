 <br />“There was one kid who, as paramedics were loading him into the ambulance, asked his friends to take his burger to the hospital with him.”<br />One aspect that I admired about <em>Chew On This</em> by Eric Schlosser (author of <em>Fast Food Nation) </em>and Charles Wilson, a book about the role of fast food in our society, is that it goes into lots of detail and does not just focus on one subject.  Instead it broadens out into many fields, such as the following:
<ul>
	<li>the meatpacking industry</li>
	<li>the french fry industry</li>
	<li>the fast food companies</li>
	<li>the flavor industry</li>
</ul>
For example, the authors talked about how these fast food companies go and advertise and sell in schools and to young kids who are only about seven years old. The authors also describe meatpacking companies where the workers don’t bother pulling the rats out of the meat that we EAT.  They also reveal that the average small french fry order at McDonald's has more than triple the fat that a Big Mac has.  I also learned the flavor industry is so advanced that they can make a food taste and smell like body odor.  Finally, did you know that the fast food companies encourage the drinking of a six-pack of Coke every day? I had no idea until reading this hard-hitting work of non-fiction.<br />The reason that I picked up <em>Chew On This</em> was because I wanted to know the truth about what we eat.  Schlosser has taken his <em>Fast Food Nation </em>research and made it accessible to younger readers like me. Once I picked up this book I could not put it down, because the authors include excellent diction and such detailed description.  I was horrified, intrigued and informed all at once.  This read made me more aware of the some of the horrors of the fast food industry.<br />I think that <em>Chew on This</em> helps us by telling us what our food is really going through, and what is really in our food; I think that this will help us by educating us in this subject.  If you liked or even watched the movie <em>Fed Up</em> then you will love this book.  I would rate this book a 10 out of a 10.  I would recommend this book to ages ten and up.<br />Christian
