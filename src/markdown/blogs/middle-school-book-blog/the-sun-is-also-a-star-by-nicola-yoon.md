<p>Natasha and her family are immigrants from Jamaica, who moved to New York City when she was eight years old. She only has one day left before she and her family are deported to Jamaica, leaving the world she has created behind. Natasha decides to walk the depths of Times Square to distract her from this reality, when her life almost flashes before her eyes: a car comes speeding towards her. Luckily Daniel, a boy who is living under his parents’ expectations to become a doctor and with his not-so-nice brother Charlie, is in the right moment at the right time and saves Natasha from getting hit. Daniel doesn’t leave Natasha’s side after the incident, as he gets a different feeling that he has never felt with anyone else he’s ever met before. Daniel is convinced that he can make Natasha fall in love in just one day. Although he has a lot of hope for his unheard-of plan, Natasha is not one to believe in “love at first sight.” She prefers sticking to the facts and research. Natasha may not believe in love, but Daniel is on a mission to convince her otherwise with the only day they’ve got left together.</p>

<p>I had a great experience reading <em>The Sun Is Also a Star. </em>Although it fell under the genre of contemporary realistic fiction, it wasn’t like any other book I’ve read before. One of the key elements I loved reading throughout the book was how Nicola Yoon structured the character development between Natasha and Daniel. The two have awkward and tense energy between them initially, but as they start talking more, readers can see them warming up to each other, making it feel as though they’ve known each other for the longest time. The development of them individually is fascinating, too. Natasha starts out skeptical and always seems to be on edge. But when she meets Daniel, he helps her loosen up a little bit, making her feel more comfortable and at ease as she gets to know him better. Yoon has Daniel lack a lot of confidence to start out. His parents want him to be a doctor even though that’s not the path he wants to go down. He’s also used to Charlie always being rude to him, but he would never stand up for himself. I found it satisfying when Daniel slowly starts gaining confidence as he sticks up for himself against his brother and tells his parents he doesn’t want to do what they want him to do—all because he met Natasha. If Natasha and Daniel hadn’t met, they would still have these insecurities to struggle with.</p>

<p>I liked how Yoon structured the narrative because one essential feature for any book is having multiple perspectives to create a balance with different characters, instead of having it told through one character. This creates more depth and can be easier to understand. I found the way Yoon crafted the different chapters interesting. Most of the chapters alternate between Natasha and Daniel’s perspective, but some chapters include side characters that the two meet throughout the story, and some chapters are written as meanings or definitions that have to do with the situation Natasha and Daniel are in. This intrigued me because I’d never read a book like that, but I really enjoyed it. It created more clarification that was essential for the book. I also found it different how Yoon chose to have varying chapter lengths, from two words to six full pages, which was unexpected to me but added suspense and wonder about what the next chapter will say, which I thought was smart for Yoon to do.</p>

<p>The pace of the book was neither fast nor slow. It was a pace that was perfect for me because I never felt bored, but I also didn’t feel rushed or caught off guard while reading. It’s rare to find a book with a pace that is perfectly fitted for the reader such as myself. With this in mind, reading did not feel like a chore or homework because Yoon kept the situation alive and exciting throughout the entire story, making it difficult for me to put the book down whenever I came to a new chapter, which I admired greatly. I rate <em>The Sun Is Also a Star </em>a very strong ten out of ten because it was everything I could’ve wanted in a book: an intriguing title, two main characters in their teens finding their own way in life, a complex setting like New York City, an effective main problem spread evenly throughout the entire story, suspenseful action that kept me on the edge of my seat, and a satisfying ending that fit perfectly. </p>

<p>I recommend <em>The Sun Is Also a Star </em>to fans of Yoon’s other book <em>Everything, Everything, </em>contemporary realistic fiction lovers, and ultimately anyone who’s looking for a detailed story to get hooked on. <em>The Sun Is Also a Star is </em>also <em>“The #1 New York Times Bestseller,” </em>was one of the National Book award Finalists<em>, </em>and is now a major motion picture. Readers will not regret reading this masterpiece of a story.</p>
