<strong><em/></strong>Teenage pickpocket Flick has abandoned his formerly glamorous lifestyle and is now living on the streets of the Lower East Side, stealing from civilians with a “flick” of his wrist. While eating breakfast at a Chinatown restaurant, Flick encounters the mysterious Lucian Mandel, headmaster of Mandel Academy. Flick is offered a place at the school to settle a disagreement between his abusive, alcoholic father, who is on the school board, and Mr. Mandel. Flick’s acceptance and to graduation from the academy will be traded for the information about how his younger brother really died.<br />Mandel Academy is a well-known school famous for enrolling teenagers from the streets and producing Ivy League-bound students and future corrupt millionaires. Flick accepts Mr. Mandel’s offer and discovers that the academy is not what he thought it would be. There are classes like hand-to-hand combat and crime scene cleaning—“skills for real life,” as Mr. Mandel calls the classes—and tracking chips implanted in students upon arrival, and the consequences for failure could be deadly.<br />I appreciated how Miller included an Addendum in the back of the book about the characters’ because it gave the reader more insight into their lives before the academy, which I really enjoyed. While I was reading the book I was hoping for more information on the secondary characters past lives and backgrounds. The Addendum also includes blueprints of the school, which helped me picture the school in my mind. I noticed and enjoyed the strong character development. When the book starts Flick is focused on getting revenge on his father and is whiny and ignorant. As the book progresses he becomes less focused on revenge and more concentrated on stopping Mr. Mandel from his evil plan. I could see Flick understanding that he can’t do everything on his own, and I appreciated that detail. I rated this amazing book a 10 out of 10.<br /><em>How to Lead a Life of Crime </em>was funny, action-packed, and mysterious. I would recommend this gripping book to both boys and girls who love a good action-adventure story and like to be on the edge of their seats.<br />Lacey<br />Razor Bill, 434 pages
