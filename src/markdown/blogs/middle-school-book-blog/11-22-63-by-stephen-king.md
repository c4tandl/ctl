In this stunning novel, Stephen King tells the story of Jake Epping, a high school English teacher who reads an essay by Harry, one of his GED students who is a janitor at his school. The essay explains the night that Harry’s family was murdered. So when his buddy, Al, discovers a time portal to 1958 in Lisbon, Maine, Jake doesn’t hesitate to embark on an adventure to save Harry’s family. But as he continues to make his way in 1958, he asks himself a bigger question: What if John F. Kennedy hadn’t been assassinated?<br />King splits the book up into six parts that separate different parts of Jake’s life during his mission. For example, one is called “The Janitor’s Father”, so the reader knows that King is going to talk about Harry’s dad, who murdered his family. The sections made the long book less intimidating for me. Also, even though I knew nothing about the Kennedy assassination, King made it possible for me to learn along the way, because Jake is also learning as he goes. This was a good technique, because it made me feel like I was Jake Epping.<br />I rated this book a ten because I loved the concept, which is the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect is a theory that if something is changed in the past or present, it might create a domino effect and change something else in the world. Learning in depth through amazing examples made me rethink some of my own actions. I also loved the balance between action and suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />King made a clear movie in my mind, since I saw the same things that Jake sees. He can do this because Jake is a first-person narrator. I liked that because it made me feel like I was right there with him.<br />I would recommend <em>11/22/63</em> to Stephen King lovers, people who have enjoyed movies like <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>, or anyone who enjoys the longing to find out what will happen next. I wonder whether since I read <em>11/22/63</em> I might have changed something in the world’s future. Maybe this review will change your future.<br />Scribner, 849 pages<br />Claire<br /> <br />
