CTL’s Justice, Equity, and Inclusion Committee meets weekly; meetings are open to all community members. 

Conversations about equity and inclusion at CTL are grounded in the shared acknowledgements that systemic racism is real and that racism negatively impacts ***all*** people. 

The CTL Justice, Equity, and Inclusion Committee currently functions in two ways: to provide a support and conversation group for community members who desire to engage weekly in conversation about inclusion and to plan for school- and community-wide events, trips, and other learning opportunities. Some past and upcoming community events include Racial Equity Insitute’s Groundwater Training, the walking tour called *A People’s History of Portland*, and an online viewing of the Wabanaki truth and reconciliation film, *Dawnland*. 

As this work continues to evolve at CTL, the committee and the wider community are eager and ready to respond and change course as is appropriate. Our hope is for continued learning and community collaboration as we forge a path together. 

CTL seeks to enroll and employ people from the widest range of backgrounds, identities,  religions, ethnicities, races, and orientations.
