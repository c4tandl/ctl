**Pia Neilson**, Co-President\
Originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, Pia moved in 1983 to the US and in 2000 to Arrowsic, Maine, where she lives with her husband Will. She is a retired entrepreneur and also a Commissioner of the Bath Housing Authority. Her youngest, Amelia, graduated from CTL in 2009 after nine wonderful years. Coming back to CTL after a decade away, Pia is impressed and gratified to see the same joyful engagement on the part of today’s students, faculty, and parents that she experienced twenty years prior, and she is delighted to help sustain that experience for generations of children and parents to come.

**Joshua Manahan**, Co-President\
Josh is parent to Kelly, who began his CTL career as a kindergartener in 2016. Josh has lived in Alna with his wife Abby since 2004. Although spending much of his time building and selling painting supports as well as cutting boards for midcoast artists through The nEAT Kitchen, the practice of reading and writing remains an important outlet for him. Josh regularly regrets being too embarrassed to ask for help with math when he was a student. He is honored to be able to share his perspective as CTL strives to honor and learn from its past, while charting an exciting future.

**Anne Atwell Merkel**, Clerk\
Anne has been CTL’s teacher of grades 7-8 writing, reading, and history since 2013 and is a member of the Class of 2000. With her mother, Nancie Atwell, she is a co-author of *The Reading Zone, Second Edition: How to Help Kids Become Skilled, Passionate, Habitual, Critical Readers*, based on their work with readers at CTL. One of Anne’s earliest memories is standing with her mom, at sunset, on the land on Cross Point Road that would become home to, so far, thirty years’ worth of writers, readers, mathematicians, historians, scientists, and artists. She has considered it her own second home ever since.

**Maureen Barbieri**\
Maureen was a middle school teacher whose work was dramatically influenced by Nancie Atwell’s first book In the Middle and by Nancie’s subsequent articles, books, and presentations. Nancie invited her to CTL in its early days, and many times over the years, so she developed a deep appreciation for the pedagogy, school culture, and commitment to excellence the whole school community embodies. A faculty member at NYU and UNH for many years, she is now at Stenhouse Publishers, editing books by and for teachers. She lives in Kittery, ME and is grateful to be a part of the CTL family.
