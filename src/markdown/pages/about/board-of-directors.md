**Pia Neilson**, Co-President\
Originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, Pia moved in 1983 to the US and in 2000 to Arrowsic, Maine, where she lives with her husband Will. She is a retired entrepreneur and also a Commissioner of the Bath Housing Authority. Her youngest, Amelia, graduated from CTL in 2009 after nine wonderful years. Coming back to CTL after a decade away, Pia is impressed and gratified to see the same joyful engagement on the part of today’s students, faculty, and parents that she experienced twenty years prior, and she is delighted to help sustain that experience for generations of children and parents to come.

**Joshua Manahan**, Co-President\
Josh is parent to Kelly, who began his CTL career as a kindergartener in 2016. Josh has lived in Alna with his wife Abby since 2004. Although spending much of his time building and selling painting supports as well as cutting boards for midcoast artists through The nEAT Kitchen, the practice of reading and writing remains an important outlet for him. Josh regularly regrets being too embarrassed to ask for help with math when he was a student. He is honored to be able to share his perspective as CTL strives to honor and learn from its past, while charting an exciting future.

**Maureen Barbieri**\
Maureen was a middle school teacher whose work was dramatically influenced by Nancie Atwell’s first book *In the Middle* and by Nancie’s subsequent articles, books, and presentations. Nancie invited her to CTL in its early days, and many times over the years, so she developed a deep appreciation for the pedagogy, school culture, and commitment to excellence the whole school community embodies. A faculty member at NYU and UNH for many years, she is now at Stenhouse Publishers, editing books by and for teachers. She lives in Kittery, ME and is grateful to be a part of the CTL family.

Katy’s children, Madoka, class of 2023, and Ryo, class of 2026, have attended CTL since kindergarten and she feels grateful every day for the opportunity to share the joy that both children have found at CTL: Gigi’s dedication to reading, writing, art, and math and Ryo’s adventures with all his school subjects and recess. Katy is a graphic designer in the marketing department of the MIT Press, working remotely from Maine since 2008. She hopes to bring her experience with visual and marketing communications to help share CTL's mission with the local and broader community.
