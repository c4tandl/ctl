## The Basics

* small class sizes (16-18 students)
* an outstanding faculty of dedicated professionals whose every decision is based on knowledge of and love for their students
* a bright, inviting, art-filled environment
* a community where every child is known, accepted, and respected—where the social rule “You can’t say you can’t play” prevents bullying and exclusion
* smooth transitions between grades and teachers, thanks to a faculty that’s on the same page about methods for teaching and being with children
* never a raised voice or standardized test
* a student population that represents the full range of socioeconomic and racial diversity found in Midcoast Maine
* affordable tuition that’s one-third the rate of comparable Maine independent schools, with generous tuition assistance
