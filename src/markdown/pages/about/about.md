## The Basics

- small class sizes (16-18 students, with just 8-9 in kindergarten)
- an outstanding faculty of dedicated professionals whose every decision is based on knowledge of and love for their students
- a bright, inviting, art-filled environment
- a community where every child is known, accepted, and respected—where the social rule “You can’t say you can’t play” prevents bullying and exclusion
- a full-day kindergarten program focused on helping children feel secure and competent as they learn the essentials of writing, reading, and math and bond with a teacher and classmates
- smooth transitions between grades and teachers, thanks to a faculty that’s on the same page about methods for teaching and being with children
- never a raised voice or standardized test
- a student population that represents many levels of ability and socioeconomic backgrounds
- affordable tuition that’s one-third the rate of comparable Maine independent schools, with generous tuition assistance
