# Visit a Morning Meeting

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/center-for-teaching-learning/image/upload/v1710385519/school.1080.37_rq7fgb_weebln.jpg)

Every morning from 8:30-8:50, CTL students and teachers of grades Pre-K--8 gather together to start our day together. Itâ€™s a joyous occasion that exemplifies the tone of the school, its feeling of community, and the respect granted to every child.

You and your child are cordially invited to visit a morning meeting and join us as we celebrate birthdays, discuss current events, review policies and procedures, sing, recite a poem,and begin the day with laughter.

Afterward, Katy Inman, our Head of School, is available to give you a tour of the school and an opportunity to glimpse our award-winning program in action. To arrange to visit a CTL morning meeting, please call her at 882-9706. Typically visits are scheduled on Thursdays and Fridays.
