# Visit a Morning Meeting

Every morning from 8:30-8:50, CTL students and teachers of grades K-8 gather together to start our day together. Itâ€™s a joyous occasion that exemplifies the tone of the school, its feeling of community, and the respect granted to every child.

You and your child are cordially invited to visit a morning meeting and join us as we celebrate birthdays, discuss current events, review policies and procedures, sing, recite a poem,and begin the day with laughter.

Afterward, Katy Inman, our Head of School, is available to give you a tour of the school and an opportunity to glimpse our award-winning program in action. To arrange to visit a CTL morning meeting, please call her at 882-9706.

Directions from the Boothbay Region: North on Route 27; a left turn onto Eddy Road after Chase & Associates, then a left turn onto Cross Point Road: CTL is located about a half mile down on the right (past the old Edgecomb public school).

From Damariscotta or Wiscasset: Travel Route 1 to the Route 27 South junction, then drive south (toward the Boothbay Region) and make a right turn onto Mason Road (one mile from Route 1); turn right onto Eddy Road; then take an immediate left onto Cross Point Road and drive about a half mile farther to CTL (past the old Edgecomb public school).
