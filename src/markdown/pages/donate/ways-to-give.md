For the past thirty years, the Center for Teaching and Learning has been bringing forward innovative, research-based teaching practices and then passing them along to colleagues everywhere. CTL faculty members conduct research, write and speak about our discoveries, and demonstrate our methods to visiting teachers. We live this facet of our mission not in competition with public school teachers, but in rich collaboration.

A book and DVD about our program, Systems to Transform Your Classroom and School, was published in 2014 by Heinemann, with all royalties supporting tuition assistance. The third edition of my book In the Middle, released in 2015, is filled with stories about and by CTL students. And our Facebook page, viewable by all at www.facebook.com/CTLKto8, shows the teachers and children in joyful action. Please “like” us to stay updated.

We embrace our responsibility to the children entrusted to our care with a curriculum that inspires curiosity and enthusiasm and delivers sense and satisfaction. When visitors remark on how good our kids are—how intentional, respectful, and accomplished—we’re proud, of course, of the culture of engagement and excellence that thrives here. We also point out the unique nature of our student body.

As a demonstration school, CTL serves a purposeful diversity of local kids, ability-wise and socioeconomically. Their parents represent many walks of life; some live below the federal poverty line. We maintain a tuition rate that’s one-third that of comparable independent schools in our area, and we substantially subsidize the fees of low-income families. Last year, fewer than 20% of students paid the full tuition rate.

It’s more important than ever that the school survives and the faculty continues to write, speak out, and demonstrate that effective schools depend on informed teachers who are encouraged to work together, innovate, and inspire every child to excellence.

I hope you will deem CTL worthy of your tax-deductible support. A contribution of any size will make a difference in the lives of CTL students, as well as those of countless children and teachers beyond our little school.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Nancie Atwell, Founder
