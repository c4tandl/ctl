# Our Mission

</br>

The Center for Teaching and Learning is a Pre-K--8 demonstration school dedicated to the development and dissemination of authentic, joyful methods for teaching across the curriculum.

We seek to teach and influence both a cross-section of children of mid-coastal Maine and, through our intern program, speeches, and publications, classroom teachers throughout the U.S.
