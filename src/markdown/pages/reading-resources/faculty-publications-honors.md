**Nancie Atwell, CTL’s Founder**

Nancie Atwell is one of the most respected educators in the U.S. and across the world.  Winner of the [Varkey Foundation's inaugural Global teacher Prize](https://www.globalteacherprize.org/winners/nancie-atwell/), she donated the $1 million award to the Center for Teaching and Learning, the K-8 demonstration school she founded in Edgecomb, Maine, in 1990. Nancie’s classic *In the Middle*, now in its third edition, has inspired generations of teachers; in it she describes her teaching journey and the practices she developed that led to her nomination. Thomas Newkirk calls *In the Middle* “the greatest book on literacy teaching ever written in this country.” Visit [Heinemann.com/InTheMiddle](http://heinemann.com/InTheMiddle) for more about the book and Nancie.

A middle school English teacher for almost forty years, Nancie is also the first classroom teacher to be awarded the NCTE David H. Russell Award and the MLA Mina P. Shaughnessy Prize, both for distinguished research in the teaching of English. She was also honored as NCTE’s Outstanding Middle School English Teacher and as the River of Words Poetry Teacher of the Year. She has received honorary doctoral degrees from Middlebury College and the University of New Hampshire.

Nancie’s books for Heinemann include *Systems to Transform Your Classroom and School*, which takes teachers inside her award-winning school to learn about the innovations that make the biggest impact on achievement and community; *Lessons That Change Writers*, a year’s worth of instruction straight from Nancie’s file cabinets; and *Naming the World: A Year of Poems and Lessons*, which helps teachers to jumpstart their teaching of writing and literature each day by unpacking a poem with their students. Her DVDs *Writing in the Middle* and *Reading in the Middle* give teachers a seat in her workshop as she presents lessons and conducts conferences that transform her students’ literacy—and their lives.
